.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

pg_ctl
is a utility for initializing a
PostgreSQL
database cluster, starting, stopping, or restarting the
PostgreSQL
database server (\fBpostgres\fR(1)), or displaying the status of a running server\&. Although the server can be started manually,
pg_ctl
encapsulates tasks such as redirecting log output and properly detaching from the terminal and process group\&. It also provides convenient options for controlled shutdown\&.
.PP
The
\fBinit\fR
or
\fBinitdb\fR
mode creates a new
PostgreSQL
database cluster\&. A database cluster is a collection of databases that are managed by a single server instance\&. This mode invokes the
\fBinitdb\fR
command\&. See
\fBinitdb\fR(1)
for details\&.
.PP
In
\fBstart\fR
mode, a new server is launched\&. The server is started in the background, and its standard input is attached to
/dev/null
(or
nul
on Windows)\&. On Unix\-like systems, by default, the server\*(Aqs standard output and standard error are sent to
pg_ctl\*(Aqs standard output (not standard error)\&. The standard output of
pg_ctl
should then be redirected to a file or piped to another process such as a log rotating program like
rotatelogs; otherwise
\fBpostgres\fR
will write its output to the controlling terminal (from the background) and will not leave the shell\*(Aqs process group\&. On Windows, by default the server\*(Aqs standard output and standard error are sent to the terminal\&. These default behaviors can be changed by using
\fB\-l\fR
to append the server\*(Aqs output to a log file\&. Use of either
\fB\-l\fR
or output redirection is recommended\&.
.PP
In
\fBstop\fR
mode, the server that is running in the specified data directory is shut down\&. Three different shutdown methods can be selected with the
\fB\-m\fR
option\&.
\(lqSmart\(rq
mode (the default) waits for all active clients to disconnect and any online backup to finish\&. If the server is in hot standby, recovery and streaming replication will be terminated once all clients have disconnected\&.
\(lqFast\(rq
mode does not wait for clients to disconnect and will terminate an online backup in progress\&. All active transactions are rolled back and clients are forcibly disconnected, then the server is shut down\&.
\(lqImmediate\(rq
mode will abort all server processes immediately, without a clean shutdown\&. This will lead to a crash\-recovery run on the next restart\&.
.PP

\fBrestart\fR
mode effectively executes a stop followed by a start\&. This allows changing the
\fBpostgres\fR
command\-line options\&.
.PP

\fBreload\fR
mode simply sends the
\fBpostgres\fR
process a
SIGHUP
signal, causing it to reread its configuration files (postgresql\&.conf,
pg_hba\&.conf, etc\&.)\&. This allows changing of configuration\-file options that do not require a complete restart to take effect\&.
.PP

\fBstatus\fR
mode checks whether a server is running in the specified data directory\&. If it is, the
PID
and the command line options that were used to invoke it are displayed\&. If the server is not running, the process returns an exit status of 3\&.
.PP
In
\fBpromote\fR
mode, the standby server that is running in the specified data directory is commanded to exit recovery and begin read\-write operations\&.
.PP

\fBkill\fR
mode allows you to send a signal to a specified process\&. This is particularly valuable for
Microsoft Windows
which does not have a
kill
command\&. Use
\-\-help
to see a list of supported signal names\&.
.PP

\fBregister\fR
mode allows you to register a system service on
Microsoft Windows\&. The
\fB\-S\fR
option allows selection of service start type, either
\(lqauto\(rq
(start service automatically on system startup) or
\(lqdemand\(rq
(start service on demand)\&.
.PP

\fBunregister\fR
mode allows you to unregister a system service on
Microsoft Windows\&. This undoes the effects of the
\fBregister\fR
command\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-core\-file\fR
.RS 4
Attempt to allow server crashes to produce core files, on platforms where this is possible, by lifting any soft resource limit placed on core files\&. This is useful in debugging or diagnosing problems by allowing a stack trace to be obtained from a failed server process\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D \fR\fB\fIdatadir\fR\fR, \fB\-\-pgdata \fR\fB\fIdatadir\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the file system location of the database files\&. If this is omitted, the environment variable
\fBPGDATA\fR
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l \fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR, \fB\-\-log \fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Append the server log output to
\fIfilename\fR\&. If the file does not exist, it is created\&. The
umask
is set to 077, so access to the log file is disallowed to other users by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m \fR\fB\fImode\fR\fR, \fB\-\-mode \fR\fB\fImode\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the shutdown mode\&.
\fImode\fR
can be
smart,
fast, or
immediate, or the first letter of one of these three\&. If this is omitted,
smart
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies options to be passed directly to the
\fBpostgres\fR
command\&.
.sp
The options should usually be surrounded by single or double quotes to ensure that they are passed through as a group\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o \fR\fB\fIinitdb\-options\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies options to be passed directly to the
\fBinitdb\fR
command\&.
.sp
The options should usually be surrounded by single or double quotes to ensure that they are passed through as a group\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the location of the
postgres
executable\&. By default the
postgres
executable is taken from the same directory as
\fBpg_ctl\fR, or failing that, the hard\-wired installation directory\&. It is not necessary to use this option unless you are doing something unusual and get errors that the
postgres
executable was not found\&.
.sp
In
init
mode, this option analogously specifies the location of the
initdb
executable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
.RS 4
Print only errors, no informational messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
The maximum number of seconds to wait when waiting for startup or shutdown to complete\&. The default is 60 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the
pg_ctl
version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR
.RS 4
Wait for the startup or shutdown to complete\&. Waiting is the default option for shutdowns, but not startups\&. When waiting for startup,
\fBpg_ctl\fR
repeatedly attempts to connect to the server\&. When waiting for shutdown,
\fBpg_ctl\fR
waits for the server to remove its
PID
file\&.
\fBpg_ctl\fR
returns an exit code based on the success of the startup or shutdown\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR
.RS 4
Do not wait for startup or shutdown to complete\&. This is the default for start and restart modes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show help about
pg_ctl
command line arguments, and exit\&.
.RE
.SS "Options for Windows"
.PP
\fB\-N \fR\fB\fIservicename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Name of the system service to register\&. The name will be used as both the service name and the display name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P \fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR
.RS 4
Password for the user to start the service\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIstart\-type\fR\fR
.RS 4
Start type of the system service to register\&. start\-type can be
auto, or
demand, or the first letter of one of these two\&. If this is omitted,
auto
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
User name for the user to start the service\&. For domain users, use the format
DOMAIN\eusername\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
\fBPGDATA\fR
.RS 4
Default data directory location\&.
.RE
.PP

\fBpg_ctl\fR, like most other
PostgreSQL
utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by
libpq
(see
Section 31.14, \(lqEnvironment Variables\(rq, in the documentation)\&. For additional server variables, see
\fBpostgres\fR(1)\&.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
postmaster\&.pid
.RS 4
The existence of this file in the data directory is used to help
pg_ctl
determine if the server is currently running\&.
.RE
.PP
postmaster\&.opts
.RS 4
If this file exists in the data directory,
pg_ctl
(in
\fBrestart\fR
mode) will pass the contents of the file as options to
postgres, unless overridden by the
\fB\-o\fR
option\&. The contents of this file are also displayed in
\fBstatus\fR
mode\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.SS "Starting the Server"
.PP
To start the server:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl start\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To start the server, waiting until the server is accepting connections:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl \-w start\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To start the server using port 5433, and running without
\fBfsync\fR, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl \-o "\-F \-p 5433" start\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Stopping the Server"
.PP
To stop the server, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl stop\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The
\fB\-m\fR
option allows control over
\fIhow\fR
the server shuts down:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl stop \-m fast\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Restarting the Server"
.PP
Restarting the server is almost equivalent to stopping the server and starting it again, except that
\fBpg_ctl\fR
saves and reuses the command line options that were passed to the previously running instance\&. To restart the server in the simplest form, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl restart\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To restart the server, waiting for it to shut down and restart:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl \-w restart\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To restart using port 5433, disabling
\fBfsync\fR
upon restart:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl \-o "\-F \-p 5433" restart\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Showing the Server Status"
.PP
Here is sample status output from
pg_ctl:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_ctl status\fR
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 13718)
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres "\-D" "/usr/local/pgsql/data" "\-p" "5433" "\-B" "128"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This is the command line that would be invoked in restart mode\&.
