.SH "NAME"
pg_receivexlog \- streams transaction logs from a PostgreSQL cluster
.\" pg_receivexlog
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpg_receivexlog\fR\ 'u
\fBpg_receivexlog\fR [\fIoption\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

pg_receivexlog
is used to stream transaction log from a running
PostgreSQL
cluster\&. The transaction log is streamed using the streaming replication protocol, and is written to a local directory of files\&. This directory can be used as the archive location for doing a restore using point\-in\-time recovery (see
Section 24.3, \(lqContinuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)\(rq, in the documentation)\&.
.PP

pg_receivexlog
streams the transaction log in real time as it\*(Aqs being generated on the server, and does not wait for segments to complete like
archive_command
does\&. For this reason, it is not necessary to set
archive_timeout
when using
pg_receivexlog\&.
.PP
The transaction log is streamed over a regular
PostgreSQL
connection, and uses the replication protocol\&. The connection must be made with a superuser or a user having
REPLICATION
permissions (see
Section 20.2, \(lqRole Attributes\(rq, in the documentation), and
pg_hba\&.conf
must explicitly permit the replication connection\&. The server must also be configured with
max_wal_senders
set high enough to leave at least one session available for the stream\&.
.PP
If the connection is lost, or if it cannot be initially established, with a non\-fatal error,
pg_receivexlog
will retry the connection indefinitely, and reestablish streaming as soon as possible\&. To avoid this behavior, use the
\-n
parameter\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following command\-line options control the location and format of the output\&.
.PP
\fB\-D \fR\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR, \fB\-\-directory=\fR\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR
.RS 4
Directory to write the output to\&.
.sp
This parameter is required\&.
.RE
.PP
The following command\-line options control the running of the program\&.
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-loop\fR
.RS 4
Don\*(Aqt loop on connection errors\&. Instead, exit right away with an error\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Enables verbose mode\&.
.RE
.PP
The following command\-line options control the database connection parameters\&.
.PP
\fB\-h \fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR, \fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running\&. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket\&. The default is taken from the
\fBPGHOST\fR
environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR, \fB\-\-port=\fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections\&. Defaults to the
\fBPGPORT\fR
environment variable, if set, or a compiled\-in default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s \fR\fB\fIinterval\fR\fR, \fB\-\-status\-interval=\fR\fB\fIinterval\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the number of seconds between status packets sent back to the server\&. This is required if replication timeout is configured on the server, and allows for easier monitoring\&. A value of zero disables the status updates completely\&. The default value is 10 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR, \fB\-\-username=\fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
User name to connect as\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no\-password\fR
.RS 4
Never issue a password prompt\&. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a
\&.pgpass
file, the connection attempt will fail\&. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR
.RS 4
Force
pg_receivexlog
to prompt for a password before connecting to a database\&.
.sp
This option is never essential, since
pg_receivexlog
will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication\&. However,
pg_receivexlog
will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password\&. In some cases it is worth typing
\fB\-W\fR
to avoid the extra connection attempt\&.
.RE
.PP
Other options are also available:
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the
pg_receivexlog
version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show help about
pg_receivexlog
command line arguments, and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
This utility, like most other
PostgreSQL
utilities, uses the environment variables supported by
libpq
(see
Section 31.14, \(lqEnvironment Variables\(rq, in the documentation)\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
When using
pg_receivexlog
instead of
archive_command, the server will continue to recycle transaction log files even if the backups are not properly archived, since there is no command that fails\&. This can be worked around by having an
archive_command
that fails when the file has not been properly archived yet, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
archive_command = \*(Aqsleep 5 && test \-f /mnt/server/archivedir/%f\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The initial timeout is necessary because
pg_receivexlog
works using asynchronous replication and can therefore be slightly behind the master\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To stream the transaction log from the server at
mydbserver
and store it in the local directory
/usr/local/pgsql/archive:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_receivexlog \-h mydbserver \-D /usr/local/pgsql/archive\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
