>  Range types are data types representing a range of values of some
  element type (called the range's <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>subtype</I
>).
  For instance, ranges
  of <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> might be used to represent the ranges of
  time that a meeting room is reserved. In this case the data type
  is <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>tsrange</TT
> (short for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"timestamp range"</SPAN
>),
  and <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> is the subtype.  The subtype must have
  a total order so that it is well-defined whether element values are
  within, before, or after a range of values.
 </P
><P
>  Range types are useful because they represent many element values in a
  single range value, and because concepts such as overlapping ranges can
  be expressed clearly. The use of time and date ranges for scheduling
  purposes is the clearest example; but price ranges, measurement
  ranges from an instrument, and so forth can also be useful.

><P
>   Each range type has a constructor function with the same name as the range
   type.  Using the constructor function is frequently more convenient than
   writing a range literal constant, since it avoids the need for extra
   quoting of the bound values.  The constructor function
   accepts two or three arguments.  The two-argument form constructs a range
   in standard form (lower bound inclusive, upper bound exclusive), while
   the three-argument form constructs a range with bounds of the form
   specified by the third argument.
   The third argument must be one of the strings
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>()</TT
>"</SPAN
>,
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>-- The full form is: lower bound, upper bound, and text argument indicating
-- inclusivity/exclusivity of bounds.
SELECT numrange(1.0, 14.0, '(]');

-- If the third argument is omitted, '[)' is assumed.
SELECT numrange(1.0, 14.0);

-- Although '(]' is specified here, on display the value will be converted to
-- canonical form, since int8range is a discrete range type (see below).
SELECT int8range(1, 14, '(]');

-- Using NULL for either bound causes the range to be unbounded on that side.

CLASS="TYPE"

>date</TT

   In these types two elements can be said to be adjacent, when there are
   no valid values between them.  This contrasts with continuous ranges,
   where it's always (or almost always) possible to identify other element
   values between two given values.  For example, a range over the
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
> type is continuous, as is a range over <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
>.
   (Even though <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> has limited precision, and so could
   theoretically be treated as discrete, it's better to consider it continuous
   since the step size is normally not of interest.)
  </P
><P
>   Another way to think about a discrete range type is that there is a clear
   idea of a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"next"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"previous"</SPAN
> value for each element value.
   Knowing that, it is possible to convert between inclusive and exclusive
   representations of a range's bounds, by choosing the next or previous
   element value instead of the one originally given.
   For example, in an integer range type <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>[4,8]</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>(3,9)</TT

  </P
><P
>   A discrete range type should have a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>canonicalization</I
>
   function that is aware of the desired step size for the element type.
   The canonicalization function is charged with converting equivalent values
   of the range type to have identical representations, in particular
   consistently inclusive or exclusive bounds.
   If a canonicalization function is not specified, then ranges with different
   formatting will always be treated as unequal, even though they might
   represent the same set of values in reality.

NAME="RANGETYPES-DEFINING"
>8.17.8. Defining New Range Types</A
></H2
><P
>   Users can define their own range types. The most common reason to do
   this is to use ranges over subtypes not provided among the built-in
   range types.
   For example, to define a new range type of subtype <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TYPE floatrange AS RANGE (
    subtype = float8,
    subtype_diff = float8mi
);

SELECT '[1.234, 5.678]'::floatrange;</PRE
><P>

   Because <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
> has no meaningful
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"step"</SPAN
>, we do not define a canonicalization
   function in this example.
  </P
><P
>   If the subtype is considered to have discrete rather than continuous
   values, the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE TYPE</TT
> command should specify a
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>canonical</TT
> function.
   The canonicalization function takes an input range value, and must return
   an equivalent range value that may have different bounds and formatting.
   The canonical output for two ranges that represent the same set of values,
   for example the integer ranges <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>[1, 7]</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>[1,
   8)</TT
>, must be identical.  It doesn't matter which representation
   you choose to be the canonical one, so long as two equivalent values with
   different formattings are always mapped to the same value with the same
   formatting.  In addition to adjusting the inclusive/exclusive bounds
   format, a canonicalization function might round off boundary values, in
   case the desired step size is larger than what the subtype is capable of
   storing.  For instance, a range type over <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> could be
   defined to have a step size of an hour, in which case the canonicalization
   function would need to round off bounds that weren't a multiple of an hour,
   or perhaps throw an error instead.
  </P
><P
>   Defining your own range type also allows you to specify a different
   subtype B-tree operator class or collation to use, so as to change the sort
   ordering that determines which values fall into a given range.
  </P
><P
>   In addition, any range type that is meant to be used with GiST indexes
   should define a subtype difference, or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>subtype_diff</TT
>, function.
   (A GiST index will still work without <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>subtype_diff</TT
>, but it is
   likely to be considerably less efficient than if a difference function is
   provided.)  The subtype difference function takes two input values of the
   subtype, and returns their difference (i.e., <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>X</I
></TT
> minus
   <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>Y</I
></TT
>) represented as a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
> value.  In our example
   above, the function that underlies the regular <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
> minus
   operator can be used; but for any other subtype, some type conversion would
   be necessary.  Some creative thought about how to represent differences as
   numbers might be needed, too.  To the greatest extent possible, the
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>subtype_diff</TT
> function should agree with the sort ordering
   implied by the selected operator class and collation; that is, its result
   should be positive whenever its first argument is greater than its second
   according to the sort ordering.
