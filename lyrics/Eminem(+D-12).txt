I'm Infinite You heard of hell well I was sent from it I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments Now I'm trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... I'm Infinite {*scratches "time" and "is money"*} [Verse 2] Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite  defense I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium Battle a band of phony MC's and stand a lonely one Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces My a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite You heard of hell well I was sent from it I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments Now I'm trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... I'm Infinite {*scratches "time" and "is money"*} [Verse 3] Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O So I'm assuming all responsibility Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's Mic Nestler, slamming like a wrestler Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical I'd rather led a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy In fact I can't see, or can't imagine A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching So this is for my family, the kid who had a cammy on my last jam Plus the man who never had a plan B Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit... I'm Infinite You heard of hell well I was sent from it I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments Now I'm trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... I'm Infinite You heard of hell well I was sent from it I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments Now I'm trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...

Eye-Kyu: Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok) I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok) I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) Verse 1: Eminem One day I plan to be a family man happily married I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried Till I'm glad to be buried  And leave this crazy world And have at least a half a million for my baby girl It may be early to be planning this stuff Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed My hands have been cuffed But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call Way before my baby is able to crawl I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q Eye-Kyu: Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok) I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok) I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) Verse 2: Eminem I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep  Praying for sleep Dreaming with a watering mouth Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts With the root of all evil I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful And make them do shit illegal For these Grant's and Jackson's These transactions explain a man's actions But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity  Through God and there's a wish he granted me He showed me how to cope with the stress And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest To selling dope with the rest I quit smoking cess to open my chest Life is stressful inside this cesspool  Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts Kids attract static, children with automatics Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth Eye-Kyu: Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok) I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok) I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page

a sweet MC, you gotta become me If you ever wanna be one see Eminem: Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313 None of these skills you bout to see come free So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me If you ever wanna be one see Verse 1: Eye-Kyu Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right  I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch) We elevated to new heights premeditated  Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it The escalated can be put to the test of greatness Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it So I take it that's the reason I'm hated To represent my temperment If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so) Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now) Everything that you collaborate I lacerate  My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate I blasterate, and have you all running master gates And as for face clutching and touching the flows I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance  Defiance, no we won't have that You want your shit to blow up? Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack  And blast that shit to kingdom come Then bring them some of this real hip-hop  I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about And you all knew from Meeko That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno So stop that bullshit and flow Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know Chorus: Eminem So what

in the 313 You don't know shit so when you see one flee You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory It's either them or me man, kill or be killed You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty If he's acting soft and he cowers He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers You flowers got no clout with a thing You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their  fingers But you can bring yours let's see what you got But don't front and never try to be what you're not Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack  Chorus: Eye-Kyu So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313 None of these skills you just seen come free So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me So you ain't ever gonna be one see Eminem: So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313 None of these skills that you just seen come free So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me So you ain't

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight [Verse 1] I'm givin mad love, I'm snuggling hugs Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs So here's a toast to federal checks Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks I grapple an axe for them baffling acts The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit The tall shit that'l end up with his skull split Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it Baby all I wanna do is swallow one or two Smoke a little bit and follow one of you  Back home when the party ends So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints To the finest women in the audience [Chorus: Women singing] Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics) Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight Cause we came here to do this tonight Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright Cause we came here to do this tonight We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight Cause we came here to do this tonight Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright [Verse 2] Aiyyo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous Living as scandalous as a television evangelist But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters I think a living never meant for me Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally When I stumbled upon this resolution By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution You couldn't see me with binoculars I armed like an octopus Step on stage and you get socked and pushed Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back Come to battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it Every minute so when I win it you never resent it I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented You got the point when I cleverly sent it [Chorus: Women singing] Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics) Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight Cause we came here to do this tonight Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright Cause we came here to do this tonight We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight Cause we came here to do this tonight Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright [Verse 3] Eminem is heading skyward For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece  of plywood I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me With the agility to escape a killer bee colony So get your cameras and capture how miraculous  I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this I'm hazardous enough already as it is Without you adding fuel to the fire I'm cruel to the liar Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire Clinical studies show that I'm cynical There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow I'm sure the party people can agree That I'm enchanting, with the romantic Freaking the vocals so frantically So throw your hands up in the atmosphere And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like [Chorus: Women singing] Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics) Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight Cause we came here to do this tonight Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright Cause we came here to do this tonight We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight Cause we came here to do this tonight Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling

So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing As she went for my midsection I threw her down as I tore off her shirt Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work Before I hit it she said "3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass" I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok" She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS" I got up out Denaun: Hey, Maxine Maxine: What Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?

I saw my life flash in front of my eyes I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume [Verse 5] Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned They're only powerful when you got your back turned I yearned for the day that we finally met again So I can give him a taste of his own medicine He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home Beating him over the head with the telephone [Police voice] Attention all cars, attention all cars Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat He's going back to the crazy home, job well done!

Friends are people that you think are your friends But they really your enemies, with secret indentities and disguises, to hide they true colors So just when you think you close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin What is money? Money is what makes a man act funny Money is the root of all evil Money'll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down What is life?

[Eminem] Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands the shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span And for what yo' life's worth; this money is twice than You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan Maybe I need my head inside straightened Brain contemplatin, clean out the register Dip before somebody catches ya or gets ya description and sketches ya Then connects you as the prime suspect But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet Cause I got a daughter to feed And $200 ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King And have the lady at the desk bring money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack This bitch tried escapin the jack Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote You barely heard a word as she choked It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze!" But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees I bust shots, they bust back Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin a vest [Eminem] Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out We were backin out this lady's Jag started blackin out Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face Shut ya yakkin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp Drug her by her hair, smacked her up Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up Stole her car, made a profit Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window like the girl on "Set it Off" did Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool Climbed out and collapsed on the patio I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!" Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64 When they sell out in stores the price triples I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties Stood up and started to see stars Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck But I think somebody seen me maybe Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE!"

A kid who refused to respect adults Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me And I might snap, one day just like that I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack (Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid said, "It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die" I looked at my watch it was one twenty "I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?" He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse..." My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache it works" I screamed, "Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst! Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!" [N] "What's the matter?" [E] "I don't know, my leg, it hurts!" [N] "Leg?!?

Way before my baby daughter Hailey I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin And had me in the position to beat me into submission He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose, Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef" But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey!" The principal walked in (What's going on in here?) and started helpin him stomp me I made them think they beat me to death Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools "This is for every time you took my orange juice, or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk. Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt. I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good." I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot.. .. Made it home, later that same day Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed My mother started screamin, "What are you on, drugs?!? Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" (Sorry!) She beat me over the head with the remote control opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?!?" [M] "Oh my God, I'm sorry son" [E] "Shut up you cunt!" I said, "Fuck it!" Took it and stuck it back up in my head then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck Chorus [Eminem] Brain damage.. It's brain damage.. I got brain damage.. It's brain damage..

Mic check one two.. we recordin?  I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus I strangled you to death then I choked you again Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally I get you blunted off of funny home grown Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono (Ohh no!!) So if I said I never did drugs That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!) My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!) Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez Follow me and do exactly what the song says: smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?

I love you I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain? I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass  Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it 	I came to the club drunk with a fake ID Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me! 	I've been with 10 women who got HIV Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me! 	I got genital warts and it burns when I pee Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me! 	I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree You probably wanna grow up to be just like me!!!

Okay children quiet down, quiet down Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day His name is Mr. Shady Children quiet down please Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!) Mr. Shady will be your new substitute  while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!) Good luck Mr. Shady [Eminem] Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!) Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!) And even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr." He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,  and what it might do to you So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you  Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem) See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon) and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man) and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) So kids say no to drugs (that's right) So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along) Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay? [Eminem] My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?  FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back Meet Zach, twenty-one years old  After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}  His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*} And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him "Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!" cause they took it too, so they think it's funny So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem) See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right) and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right) and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can) She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack) So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right) And there's really nothin else to say (but umm) Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay? [Eminem] And last but not least, one of the most humungous problems among young people today, is fungus It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off,  bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair (Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?) cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!) See drugs are bad, it's a common fact But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't,  cause I'm bad for you Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem) See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh) and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down) and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask) She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will) So kids say no to drugs (say no) So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do) And there's really nothin else to say (that's right) Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay? [Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman) Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!) Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!) Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!) so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!) (Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!) (So, fucked up, right now..)

Hahaha! We love you! How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold.. (Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) .. or so we're told [Eminem] I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see so many motherfuckin people, who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs It's like a fuckin ARMY marchin in back of me So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays 'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days Who woulda thought; standin in this mirror bleachin my hair with some peroxide, reachin for a t-shirt to wear that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? How could I predict my words would have an impact like this? I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep tellin me, I ain't causin nuthin but problems And now they're sayin I'm in trouble with the government - I'm lovin it! I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin it on [Chorus 2X: Eminem] White America! I could be one of your kids White America! Little Eric looks just like this White America! Erica loves my shit I go to TRL; look how many hugs I get! [Eminem] Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself If they were brown Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby!) Look at my sales Let's do the math - if I was black, I woulda sold half I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin studio's at When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like Fuck it - until I met Dre, the only one to look past Gave me a chance aand I lit a FIRE up under his ass Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got Like damn; we just swapped - sittin back lookin at shit, wow I'm like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now? It's.. [Eminem] See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss 'til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence! Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came And kids flipped, when they knew I was produced by Dre That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope waitin to choke; tightenin around my throat Watchin me while I write this, like I don't like this (Nope!) All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely Hip-Hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom So now I'm catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin Actin like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit! Just look at me like I'm your closest pal The posterchild, the motherfuckin spokesman now for.. [Outro] So to the parents of America I am the derringer aimed at little Erica to attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress and piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy Fuck you Ms. Cheney!

How can one Chandra be so Levy? Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me Believe me; BET and MTV are gonna grieve when we leave dog, fo' sheezy Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me 'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains - nothin but clowns down here But we, ain't fuckin around round here Yo Dre (whattup?)

I have no snare in my headphones - there you go Yeah.. yo, yo [Eminem] Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin Tempers flarin from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin Not takin nothin from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now [Chorus: Eminem] I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you!

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin her side Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun Cuz I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and them both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" [Eminem] Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin But put yourself in my position; just try to envision witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin Goin through public housin systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely And Nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony And Hailie's gettin so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song - keep tellin yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?

It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt Knowin damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell to catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed I'm standin here swingin like thirty people by myself I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell Turned around saw Gary stashin the heater in his belt Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now I'm..

It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped I sold my soul to the devil I'll never get it back I just wanna leave this game with level head intact Imagine goin from bein a no one to seein everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceein It's fuckin crazy, cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated So I'm sayin..

From standin on corners and porches just rappin to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you to get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B! It's all political, if my music is literal and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl? I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too Guerrera - that was a FIST that hit you!

Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives 'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin to you - but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

I got my baby back Yo, check it out... [Eminem - singing] Somedays I sit, starin out the window Watchin this world pass me by Sometimes I think, there's nothin to live for I almost break down and cry Sometimes I think I'm crazy; I'm crazy, oh so crazy!! Why am I here? Am I just wastin my time?! But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy!! It all makes sense when I look into her eyes [Chorus One] Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin on me Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me [Eminem - singing] My baby girl, keeps gettin older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes, cause they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit don't phase me; inside it drives me crazy!! My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy!! It all makes sense when I look into her eyes [Chorus One] [Eminem - rapping] Man if I could sing, I'd keep singin this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin as long as my father to show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't {want her} Now you probably get this picture from my public persona that I'ma pistol packin drug addict who bags on his mama But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul And just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold and this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself but I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin - three felonies, six years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man, I should have seen it comin, what'd I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tommorrow, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted [Chorus Two] And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin on me Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier Nothing can take her from me [Eminem] Wooo! Told you I can't sing Oh well, I tried Hailie, remember when I said, if you ever need anything Daddy would be right there? Guess what?

[Intro] Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse [Eminem] Till I collapse I'm spillin these raps long as you feel 'em Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin 'em Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin 'em and I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin 'em Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hoch venom Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop Amoxacillin's just not real enough The criminal cop killin hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up? Fo' shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck [Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit, till my bones collapse [Eminem] Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin you get when you real and you spit an' people are feelin your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend tryin to hold on to it cause you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a LOT of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does NOT offend me That's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin me Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me You hate it but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me [Eminem] Soon as the verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart What is he thinkin? How not to go against me, smart! And it's absurd, how people hang on ev-ery word I'll probably NEVER get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together ev-ery verse My thoughts, are sporadic, I act, like I'm a addict I rap, like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin at 'em The track is on some battlin raps who want some static? Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is WACK if I'm not the baddest, so [Eminem] Until the roof [N.Dogg] Until the roof [Eminem] The roof comes off [N.Dogg] The roof comes off [Eminem] Until my legs [N.Dogg] Until my legs [Em + N] Give out from under me [Eminem] I will not fall, I will stand tall [Eminem] Feels like no one can beat me The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eminem f/ Hailie Jade Album: The Eminem Show Song: My Dad's Gone Crazy Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes} {*channel surfing until a kid's TV show*} Hello boys and girls!

[Verse 1] Aight c'mon, let's cut the bullshit enough, let's get it started Let's start addressin this issue and open it up Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss statements that's made on this tape and this whole origin of the music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy The music you accuse me of tryin to destroy Let's rewind it to eighty-nine, when I was a boy On the Eastside of Detroit, crossin 8 Mile into Warren In the hick territory, I'd like to share a story This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me You have well informed me, and I'm well aware that I don't belong here, you've made that perfectly clear I get my ass, kicked damn near everywhere From Bel-Air Shoppin Center just for stoppin in there From the black side all the way to the white side Okay there's a bright side, a day that I might slide You may call it a pass, I call it haulin my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks The good old notorious, so well known tracks [Chorus: repeat 2X] So let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 2] I'd roam in the streets so much, they'd call me a drifter Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up, to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke, or steal a God damn bike From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park That was the halfway mark, to me Kim had to walk Back to her momma's, from Chalmers, after dark To sneak me in the house, when I'm kicked out my mom's That's about the time, I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps at Osbourne, handin out some flyers We was doin some talent shows at Centerline High I told him to stop by and check us some time He looked at me like I'm out my mind Shook his head, like white boys don't know to rhyme I spit out a line, and rhymed birthday with first place And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit With compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line [Chrous] [Verse 3] My first year of ninth grade, can't forget that day of school It was cool, 'til your man MC Shan came through And said that "Puma's the brand, cause the Klan makes Troops" It was rumors, but man, God damn, they flew Must have been true, because man, we done banned they shoes I had the new ones, the Cool J, ice lamb, suede too But we just threw them in the trash, like they yesterday's news Guess who came through next, X-Clan debuted +Professor X+ ("Vanglorious") exist in a state of +red, black, and green with a KEY, SISSIES!+ Now with this bein the new trend, we don't fit in Crackers is out, with "Cactus Albums," blackness is in African symbols and medallions, represent black power And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard and Butter would go to the mall with them all over our necks like we're showin 'em off Not knowin at all we was bein laughed at "You ain't even half black; you ain't 'posed to have that  homey, let me grab that, and that Flava Flav clock  we gon' have to snatch that," all I remember is meetin back at Manics's basement, sayin how we hate this How racist but dope the X-Clan's tape is Which reminds me, back in eighty-nine me and Kim broke up for the first time, she was tryin to two-time me And there was this black girl at our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein me And oh, the irony, guess what her name was Ain't even gonna say it plus, the same color hair as hers was And blue contacts, and a pair of jugs The bombest God damn girl in our whole school If I could pull it, not only would I become more popular But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her But she dumped me for this black guy, and that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the "Ol' Foolish Pride" girl But I've heard people say they heard the tape, and it ain't that bad But it was, I singled out a whole race And for that I apologize (apologize) I was wrong (was wrong) Cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a ho [Outro] Shut the fuck up, you fuckin pieces of shit!

[Chorus: interpolation of "Toy Soldiers"] Step by step, heart to heart Left right left, we all fall down Like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win, but the battle wages on We're toy soldiers [Verse 1] I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I ain't never 'sposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it Even if it means goin toe to toe with the Benzino It don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle 'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie's name on a song, and I just lost it It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it That was never my object, for someone to get killed Why would I want to destroy somethin I helped build? It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career without ever mentionin {Suge} And that was just out of respect, for not runnin my mouth And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV, now I'm talkin a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business I'm still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute, because [Verse 2] There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and wouldn't have to worry about, one of your people dyin But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it? It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck him, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it, has got a grudge against me for nothin? Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then But I'm so busy bein pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder INC And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than ANY award is But I ain't tryin to have none of people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all, 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin I'm just willin to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eminem Album: Encore Song: Mosh Typed by: Shady207@ghostmail.net {with help from liner notes} [Intro: little children] I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America.. {*warplane flies overhead*} And to the republic, for which it stands..

You got me [Verse 1] Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad when I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney, Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news I try to keep up sheltered from it, but somehow it seems the harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just somethin that we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold, ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, momma's gon' be alright [Verse 2] Heh, it's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em weren't from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back on the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seein daddy on the TV And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were too young to understand it Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscin Lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment [Eminem] And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad Ha ha!

You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick You're truly the only one who can do this to me You just make me get so crazy I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanted sex You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit Cause the next day we're right back at it In the same exact pattern What the fuck is the matter with us? We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love which that is attractin us to each other They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin bitch but I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you Just cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises Always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-ture than those other little hoes who just act like little girls Like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin You play your position you never step out of line Even though I stay in your business you've always kept out of mine I wonder what's on your mind, sometimes they say love is blind Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign [Eminem - over first two lines of Chorus] Or maybe you did, maybe you like me and stuff Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove [Eminem] You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this as intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire You're my entire supply - gas, the match, and igniter The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table If you were to break I'd fall on my face But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage But you're essential to me you're the air I breathe I believe if you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be You are the Kim to my Marshall you're the Slim to my Shady The Dre to my Eminem, the Elaina to my Hailie You are the words that I'm lookin for when I'm tryin to describe how I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me [Eminem - over first two lines of Chorus] And no matter how much, too much is never enough Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eminem f/ D-12 Album: Encore Song: One Shot 2 Shot Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes} {*gun shots, crowd screaming*} I told y'all motherfuckers I was comin back (oh shit) What now nigga, what now?

I don't rap for dead presidents; I'd rather see the President {dead} It's never been said, but I set precedents and the standards and they can't stand it My name shoulda been bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered on my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot, fuck that shit I done seen how fast this rap shit can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click But this time they got fuckin auto-ma-tic Ain't no one gon' test this mon, clack-click!

Take this {*guns cocked*} You ready? One, two, three! {*two shots*} [Chorus: Eminem] The more you, put me through The more it makes me wanna come back to you You say you hate me? I just love you more You don't want me, I just want you more I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me I know it's sad but it's makin me happy The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on Cause you love me, and I love you more [Verse 1] It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin the same shit We say we do it for our baby but we don't We do it for us, it's lust, cause neither one of us trust each other So we fuck 'til we bust and we cuss each other, out We know what it's about, SHOUT 'til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth Fistfight 'til we turn this mother out Then apologize after, laughter, pain It's insane we're back in the same chapter again And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin here with you There ain't nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause [Verse 2] Cause I hate you, do you hate me? Good - cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry It makes me, wanna just take you and just throw you on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you You fuck other people and I fuck other people You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it We can make accusations, people spred rumors But they ain't got proof, if they do it's just the two of us It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she screwin me But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin.. yeah I would Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to that would be this soft and warm So it's off and on, usually more off than on But at least we know, that we share this common bond You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on I hope, the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact And plus I can bust in that and that's why [Verse 3] I can never understand it, that's why I don't try From junior high until we both die, it's silly Oh why must we try, is it really so rough that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff? Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs We're lyin to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin All we do is shove each other every other fuckin night And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent up rage we both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else, we've both been with someone else And someone else's problems neither one wants help It's an addiction and it can't be fixed Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit And they're probably just tired of hearin it all the time On every song, every lyric and every rhyme All the hoop-la, all the whoopty-woo What you put me through, fuckin whoopty-do But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love you wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up this time, cause this time girl I'm tellin you what You do it again I'm fuckin you up [Outlude] No matter what you say, or what you do I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you No matter where you run, I'll be right there Right behind you, in your nightmares So I brought you the flowers, and the candy All the times that you threw it back at me So when you hate me, you gon' hate me more When you find out, you can't escape me whore The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eminem Album: Encore (Bonus Disc) Song: Ricky Ticky Toc Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com {with help from liner notes} [Eminem] Once you call my name out things will never be the same They shoulda never let us get our foot in this game Ever since I was introduced to rap music I been missin a screw like Bishop in "Juice," I could lose it at any moment, those who know me know it So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that I don't explode and, have another episode where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did {*gun cocks*} I'm waitin for that next beef, I'm cocked locked and loaded I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin pole-vault with Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name It's a game, cause they know that they don't spit the same It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame Everyday it's the same thing People in this game try to buddy-buddy us Just to get close enough to study us Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that They all tryna get that stamp They after that Shady/Aftermath money It's like a monopoly They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully 50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers? When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered that we had more in common that we thought with each other Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us What was wrong with us, was it our fault? Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time What a coincidence it is, cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King cause Big L had just got popped just a month before If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh Operate, that's when he popped up at number one And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin Even if I'm under the gun You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye There'll always be animosity between you and I But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit Still gonna conduct motherfuckin business as usual Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these? You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dog was, hollerin, "Fuck Compton" I was whylin, freestylin Back when, they were still makin, Maxell casettes It wasn't even rap sell us yet, that tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc And ya don't stop...

From standin on corners and porches just rappin to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you to get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B! It's all political, if my music is literal and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl? I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too Guerrera - that was a FIST that hit you! [Eminem] They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives 'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin to you - but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

[Chorus: interpolation of "Toy Soldiers"] Step by step, heart to heart Left right left, we all fall down Like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win, but the battle wages on We're toy soldiers [Verse 1] I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I ain't never 'sposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it Even if it means goin toe to toe with the Benzino It don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle 'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie's name on a song, and I just lost it It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it That was never my object, for someone to get killed Why would I want to destroy somethin I helped build? It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career without ever mentionin {Suge} And that was just out of respect, for not runnin my mouth And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV, now I'm talkin a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business I'm still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute, because [Verse 2] There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and wouldn't have to worry about, one of your people dyin But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it? It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck him, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it, has got a grudge against me for nothin? Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then But I'm so busy bein pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder INC And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than ANY award is But I ain't tryin to have none of people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all, 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin I'm just willin to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eminem Album: The Marshall Mathers LP Song: The Real Slim Shady Typed by: Ghettofabulous98@hotmail.com, OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Eminem] May I have your attention please?

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They got the Discovery Channel don't they?

I should download her audio on MP3  and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD {*AHHH!*} I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you {*bzzzt*} And there's a million of us just like me who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

I have no snare in my headphones - there you go Yeah.. yo, yo [Eminem] Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin Tempers flarin from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin Not takin nothin from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now [Chorus: Eminem] I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleanin out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleanin out my closet [Eminem] Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin her side Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun Cuz I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and them both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" [Eminem] Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin But put yourself in my position; just try to envision witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin Goin through public housin systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely And Nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony And Hailie's gettin so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song - keep tellin yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I +AM+ dead - dead to you as can be!

When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armour And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you? What happens when you become the main source of a pain? "Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane "Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?" I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby... And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...

Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These stinkin' walls must be talking, cause man I can hear 'em They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on And I'm singing...

"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' "You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad "And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad' "That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin" "I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone" But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice "Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us" That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill Yeah, I bet you you will.

[Verse 2] Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana Then I reach for the Aloe and Lanolin Bust all over the wall panelling Dismantling every candle, on top of the fireplace mantling Grab my flannel and my bandana then kiss the naked mannequin man again You can see him standing in my front window, would you look in? I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens Causing illusions again, brain contusions again Cutting and bruising the skin, raise the scissors and pins Jesus when does it end, phases that I go through Dazed and I'm so confused, days that I don't know who Gave these molecules to me, what am I gon' do Hey the prodigal son, the diabolical one Very methodical when I slaughter them [Chorus x2] It's 3 A.M. in the morning Put my key in the door Bodies laying all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must have killed 'em, killed 'em I said...

ETA: 10 minutes [Eminem] As I, fall deeper into a manic state I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate Start off with the night well like "I think I'll just have a taste" Couple of sips of that, then I gradually graduate To a harder prescription drug called Valium like "Ya that's great" I go to just take one and I end up like having eight Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak And you'd think that with all I have at stake, look at my daughter's face "Mommy something is wrong with dad I think He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat" Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me as soon as I go home and close the door Kinda feels like dÈj‡ vu, I wanna get away from this place I do But I can't, and I won't, say I try, but I know, that's a lie cause I don't, and why I just don't know [Eminem] Maybe just a nice cold brew "What's a beer?" That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fuckin hear "Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers" And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half buzzed for half of the time Who's the mastermind behind that little line? With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball Shit must've knocked me out, cause I ain't feel the ground at all Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I? Man, fuck am I hungover and God damn I Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I? "All systems ready for take off please stand by" [Eminem] So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin you to get through It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze What else is new?

Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out, for you [Eminem] I'm just so fuckin depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump but I need somethin to pull me out this dump I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or, why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm startin to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow in my own sorrow, but I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles [Chorus: Eminem] In my shoes, just to see, what it's like, to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds Just to see, what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll, oh-ohh They can all get fucked, just stay true to youuuuuu, so-ohh-oh! Don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll, oh-ohh They can all get fucked, just stay true to youuuuuu, so-ohh-oh! [Eminem] Yeah I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as I walk in it's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation, like I want that I'm not lookin for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fuckin man-servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "HA! Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, goddamn!" Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles [Eminem] Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help Now I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own! I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went I dreamed of bein that cool kid, even if it meant actin stupid Aunt Edna always told me, "Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that" Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no mo' But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description Cause where you see it from where you're sittin is probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet [sample] + (Eminem) Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own (oh-ohh) Everybody has a private world where they can be, alone (so-ohh-oh!)

[Outro: Eminem - echoing] Yeah, to my babies, stay strong Daddy'll be home soon And to the rest of the world God gave you them shoes, to fit you So put 'em on and wear 'em Be yourself man, be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny Never let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful So-ohh-oh!

[Eminem] So this is it, this is what I wished for Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment I just thought the shit'd be different But somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of it I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin it And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit I just wanted a little bit Then it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocrite Concert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin in green Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine But I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for me to not go and be seen, and just go and be me And there was no in-between You either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3 then three, years later they go back and re-rate it Then called "The Slim Shady LP" the greatest "The Marshall Mathers" was a classic, "The Eminem Show" was fantastic But "Encore" just didn't have the caliber to match it I guess enough time just ain't passed yet A couple more years that shit'll be "Illmatic" And eight years later I'm still at it Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin pill addict And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk My back has been broke and I can still walk [Chorus: Eminem] So be careful what you wish forrrr Cause you just might get it, and if you get it then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld I said be careful what you wish forrrr Cause you just might get it, and if you get it then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld [Eminem] I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been prayin for me Every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy Cause I don't read every, letter I get But somethin told me to go ahead and open it But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you? You didn't pray for me when I was local And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you at least, a thousand times in these rhymes I appreciate the prayer but I've already got, God on my side And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?

Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64 When they sell out in stores the price triples I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties Stood up and started to see stars Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck But I think somebody seen me maybe Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE" and surrendered my weapon to cops Wasn't me!

Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then I decided to cut class to rap full time And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image You fuckin' pricks!

It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves - when the thought of bein thrown into an alligator pit I salivated it, weight is up Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah egos I ain't deflate enough Last chance to make this whole stadium ERUPT cause [Eminem] I can see the finish line with each line that I finish, I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault, over the goal post And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough to fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?

We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us" And the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched cause we don't know anymore what are hits Is it the beat? Is it the rap? Is it a finger snap or the same 8-0-8 clap? And how do we adapt and get TRL votes when 13-year olds control the remotes? And Ashlee's got a brand new nose We gotta put some new em-phas-is on our syl-la-lables [Jay-Z] If the emphasis on a compact disc isn't a beat then I'm gon' feature Em and get rich and let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove' Cause e'rywhere I go they love the bling-bling flow The bang-bang, look at the way my chain glow The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough (oh) The fuck am I bustin my brain fo'?

Em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-lable [Dr. Dre] Jay said 30's the new 20, funny Must mean 40's the new 30, interestin Cause ever since then it's been in essence an extension for veteran rappers that are better than half of the shit comin out right now, it's all trash The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed Jay said it's his last, then 50 and Em Then what? "Detox" drops, what do we got then? So now our whole camps is runnin around, scramblin over what to do, gamblin Every time we put a record out just lookin for that hook [Em] Wait Dre, look~!

Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you.. Chorus: {unknown singer} You ride like a cowboy toward the sun And life ain't fun, when you're on the run Got your gold and you got your gun But life as an outlaw just begun Got your shotgun by your side Got your horse and you got your pride You ride til there ain't no place to hide It's sad cause the bad guys always die [Dr. Dre] + (Eminem) He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said  (You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*} I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs We both drew at the same time and stood stunned  (Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want) I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot So what we gon' do, it's on you  (Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?) The Chronic!  (Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)  (And plus I know who's got it) Who?  (Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two) Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle  We rolled two miles until we hit the spot An old ghost town that everybody forgot A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot) (Eminem) This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless He's goin around sayin he took the game from us  [Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin] But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps [Dr. Dre] I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "G Thang," and a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin" I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray Against 1800, he pulls a AK Hollow tips started flyin every which way (Eminem) That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge I fired the first shot, spun his body around He hit the ground and landed upside down Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled Chorus 2X  Always die..

And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in the wild hood As a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood That I used as an excuse And aint shit changed But kept the same mindstate Since the third time that I failed 9th grade You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it I don't promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death As I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind You and a friend Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again Shit, why not? Blow your brain out I'm blowing mine out Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board That smashed into your Honda Accord With a 4 door Ford But a more toward (?) droppin an accapella The choppa (?) fella The mozarella Worse than a hellacopta propella Got you locked in the cella With your skeleton showing Developing anorexia While I'm standin next to ya Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death With an IV in your veins Feeding you liquid darvicet Pumping you full of drugs Pull the plugs On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs Who were picked up in an ambulance And driven To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants And given A less than 20 percent chance Of living Have a possible placement It's a hospital patient Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement Doctor Kevorkian has arrived To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!" Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth Better call the fire department I've hired a arson To set fire to carpet And burn up your entire apartment I'm a liar to start shit (?) Got your bitch wrapped around my dick So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40 Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead No more said case closed end of discussion I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas Cross the bombas (?)

You go to hell" -> Mr. Garrison [Eminem] Yo At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt Mom wouldn't take me, the bitch still hates me One day she said, "Go rake leaves," I said, "Make me!" I'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth Arguing with me and mom was on-going She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!" Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then I decided to cut class to rap full time And get the fuck outta this fake shit school and rhyme Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image Break shit!

Somebody talk to me We're almost past the point of bein able to talk this shit out Somebody better explain Why my ears are ringin so loud If someone's got somethin to say Grow some balls and say it to my face~!
