The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: Creation & Destruction Typed by: hierohead50C@hotmail.com Yeah, haha Se ha acabado la mierda (The shit is finished) Bout to drop a def' cut Yo, yo, yo, huh Immortal Technique, disintegrates mics when I spit I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Gaddafi The government took Nazi scientists from Germany To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me Their pathetic attempts, didn't work to murder me When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally Bleeding internally, burnin' D, durin' surgery, verbally 'Cause I'm a spiritual witch, devils are incompatible I've been around since the planet was inhabitable I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals But until then, I had alien women suck me off When God said "Let there be light", I turned it the fuck off And that's the reason Earth is only 5 billion years old I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold Fuck what you've been told My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region Until the skies starting raining, continuous seasons Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated Undebatably reinstated to leave you decapitated Juswifu, but my crazy words make sense I'll split every pound in your body into six pence I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense I'll leave your body drenched in the blood from all your ancestors You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molesters I'll cut you and bless your festering wounds with alcohol Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home like the Berlin Wall This is the final call, for all rappers that wanna brawl Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to diss 'Cause I allowed God to let you motherfuckers exist Hahahahaha yeah, real oh We about to crash somethin' now, yo Yo, yo, yo I'm the Stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive A European virus, mutated in Africa, overseas Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends You don't want beef with people like me, so don't pretend I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send You wanna make amends, 'cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes Buryin' your fam like Central American earthquakes Immortal Technique Harlem to Canada Lyrically damage ya Te dije que se ha acabado la mierda  (I told you the shit was over) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: Dominant Species Typed by: viktory003@yahoo.com [Intro] Yo, in a hundred years form now Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead So it's inconsequential really All the shit that you talk All the bullshit that you stand for It's more important what, what your ready to build What you're ready to pass down to your children What you're ready to create You better fucking remember that When you challenge a mother fucker like me Remember, I'm the dominant species [Verse 1] I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic The government is psychotically racist and robotic The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic Erotic conspiracy theory becomes reality Life is war, and every day's a battle to me I'm on the brink of insanity, between extreme intelligence and split personalities But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity Revolutionary conceptuality spitting out of me Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me Stupidity's not allowed by me Cuz I don't got time to play I'm the black whole lyricist that'll take your shine away Darkness at any time of day I'm the Technique and your nobody so what you trying to say Stellar density becomes your physical alignment 1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement Yo, yo, yo, I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet [Verse 2] Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite like possibilities But you don't have the capability like infertility Cuz opening your mouth to question my validity Is like trying to contradict the theory of relativity When I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery My enemies are obsessed with me like the bitch in Misery But break out like father running form responsibility Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility I balance humility, with brutal instinct I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars La Brea Tar Pit thick So don't ever talk shit And remember something nigga, while you rave and rant A roach can live for nine days without its head but you can't [Verse 3] I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits Some niggaz are too stupid to understand it like astrophysics Technique is exquisite I'll make your thoughts a victory Get pessimistic with the quickness If you think that I will just become another statistic with anything but success When I bless the mic as I spit this Specifically prolific with coprocessor coma type sickness My style is like a ten year old child with a slit wrist, too much reality For the fucking hit list I got a Black Panther mentality with a spick fist So you can get dissed Even if you're locally gold, vocally bold, or globally Multi-platinum sold I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm giving you chills I drop knowledge while these mother fuckers clumsily spill And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge I'm the lyrically apocalypse that crumbles the granite Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique f/ Big Zoo Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: Positive Balance Typed by: crackalack@winningteam.com [Intro] Big Zoo, uh Technique, uh Positive balances, uh, uh [Verse 1 - Big Zoo] Pound for pound I'm the most positive when I bust mine The Zoo adds on like a plus sign Addition, that's the key in the ignition With no pause, I propel to pole position (Vroom!) Ahead of the pack, light years ahead of the wack I give a fiend a Good Book, instead of the crack That's the gold mine, negativity can't hold mine The black bear's headed for the gold mine (look out, look out) And then I'm positive as Showtime I make negative MC's switch styles in no time They change teams, rhyme about kings and queens Instead of how they sellin' work to fiends Then I, switch thugs into soldiers Those that have given up on God to praise J Hova (Damn!) The rap Ice Age is over And positivity protects the Z boulder boulder [Chorus - Immortal Technique w/Big Zoo ad-libs] Yeah, you know how it goes, positivity, yeah My opinion is solid ground but your a common hater Splitting and dividing on numbers like a denominator Third-eye navigator movements are necessary Everything you see in videos is secondary You need positivity like you need respect in jail Because without balance you'll be making negative record sales Neg-neg-negative record sales, ziga-zam, Technique, like this [Verse 2 - Immortal Technique] I jerk off inside books and give life to words Leaving concepts stuck together you probably never heard (what?) I love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves Rappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence But I keep it positive with ultimate dominance Meditating with Native Americans close to Providence I speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows But rumor has it that you getting raped like Lil' Bow Wow Now listen industry motherfuckers, don't get offended Remember, that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda And render contenders dismembered, bend the fabric of time (what? what?) And put your soul in a blender You living a lie like thinking Jesus was born in December Instead of catering to labels, something gotta give I'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive I seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks Because without balance, you don't last more than a minute This ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage I rock shows in the ghetto, nigga you stuck in the village I wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven But I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97's So I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow Moving tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios *Biggie - Hypnotize sample* The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: The Getaway Typed by: CircleOfTyrants@aol.com * * send corrections to the typist [Immortal Technique] Yo yo, son give me that newspaper [Friend] Yeah aight, here you go [Immortal Technique] Man, I hate this one yo.

Technique will force you into strategical retreat Because I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets There ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech When I reach higher positions Without the recognition of pissed on competition Cause I conquered there ambitions In a systematic form like a religionist tradition My mission is to take you, lyrically break you Lyrically assassinate you Lyrically incinerate your body and recreate you To destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you Cause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you Your my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you The revolution of the mind that bring lee generates you But when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you Cause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin Is to be ashamed of your skin My rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin Intoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy Don't make me choke you down like Jon-Benet Ramsey Something demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily God commanded me to be a technological disease And psychologically do battle with the best emcee's *Inaudible* these in technique Cause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible Aztec like the Hannibal Rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibal's Your just a fucking animal but I'm the Neo Sapien Cause my original civilization was based upon creation You know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing I'll put your best disciple on academic probation Fuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper

happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers These days everybody trying to be a thug or a player Where did all the real motherfuckers go in the game Bring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame I remember hip hop before the mic cunt clapping Cause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers Lyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification Your not dope enough, spit self glorification So don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation Life is hard it'll leave you scarred cause I been threw shit If you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit Don't you understand the audience will listen and dance In the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance To be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher Why do you think project rooms look like the cells in Riker's I'm explaining the significance or the reason behind it There preparing your children for the prison environment When you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement But I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains Cause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain The system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory Close to hell but I rebel as begin to sparkle out And tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in Because they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape my women So I leave the system Unforgiven like East Wood Cause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could You should of seen it coming long ago when you were very young My word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son Cause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it I'll make Jesus turn around and say "yo pop this nigga flipped it" So talk about whatever and be what you wanna be But don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy Cause through the highest frequencies in the NYC I'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's (Hook) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: Dance With the Devil Typed by: dire2000@mail.com [Verse 1] I once knew a nigga whose real name was William his primary concern, was making a million being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen he used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams a corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen nigga never had a father and his mom was a feen she put the pipe down, but forever yeah she was sober her sons heart simultaneously grew colder he started hanging out selling bags in the projects checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects he was fascinated by material objects but he understood money never bought respect he build a reputation cause he could hustle and steal but got locked once it didn't hesitate to squeal so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real you see me and niggaz like this have never been equal I dont project my insurecurity's at other people he feeded for props like addicts with pipes and needles so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil a fever minded young man with infinite potetial the product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed [Hook] Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences you propably only did a month for minor offences ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance but then again there's always the wicked at new and advanced dance forever with the devil on a code cell block but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot [Verse 2] So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do he'd get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew starting fights over little shit, up on the block stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock working overtime for making money for the crack spot hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine for filling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain tired of the block niggaz treating him the same he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs but when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club but only a real thug can stab someone till they die standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well guarded and they wanted to test him, before business started suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted so now he had a choice between going back to his life or making money with made men, up in the cife his dreams about cars and ice, made him agree a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three [Hook] [Verse 3] They drove around the projects slow while it was raining smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment untill they saw a woman on the street walking alone three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw so Billy oaked her up and grapped the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around the shirt covered her face, but she screamed the clouts so Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently and then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned a broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and broos one of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two they told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute, she was practicly dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head (Sample from "Survival of the Fittest" by Mobb Deep) I'm falling and I can't turn back I'm falling and I can't turn back [Verse 4] Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life he thought about the cold pain with the platinum and ice  and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him start the cringine studder cuz he was starring into the eyes of his own mother she looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her she cried more painfully, than when they were raping her his whole world stopped, he couldn't even contiplate his corruption had succesfully changed his fate and he remembered how his mom used to come home late working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded, cause god wasn't there and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul they say death take you to a better place but I doubt it after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it and listen cause the story that I'm telling is true cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom to and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go infact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows and every street cypher listening to little thugs flowe he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know the devil grows inside the hearts of the selvish and wicked white, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted you have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted and you'll be one of gods children and fell from the top there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never because the dance with the devil might last you forever The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: Hidden Track Typed by:

What the fuck make you so special nigga? Huh... what the fuck do you do? I calculate planet alignment like Mayan astronomy Discovering atrocities worst than Aristotle Subjecting children to sodomy Your theory of the galaxy is primitive like telome The truth about the universe stuck up like Aztec pottery Unpredictable results like experimental psychology I stomp the streets with emcee's beneath my feet in colonies But presentation and spirit revolve around autonomy Searching for monogamy And cutting fake bitches out of my mind like a lobotomy So obviously I'm not gonna be here to play games Walked the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames Battle the beast and false prophet predicted in the King James I give a fuck about your emcee name I don't admire you Only by dental records will you be identifiable Cause the future is not reliable Remember when rap was not economically viable Comparable to what motherfuckers think of me I might be nobody but wait till I'm together like a symphony Resounding sound that will continue infinitely Angel of death punishing all those who live in infamy And shine so far away from you You'll never get a glimpse of me Attempts to extinguish me don't even bother me none Like retarded kids throwing ice cubes at the sun A victory against Immortal Technique will never be done Just degrees of losing it every second your adding one Some niggas dream of pushing kilos but I drop tons With more facts and formulas and philosophical logic Then a basement full of scientists puffing on chronic Dipped in mycin potassium cyanide and liquid bubonic And use it as a sonic one to find the spawn of the demonic Screaming like onyx is of absolutely no consequence The poison is dense enough to clog up your arteries Mercy is not a part of me I cause you bodily injury permanently be simply verbally murdering me Is inconceivable cause of the unbelievable evil injected inside The blood stream of my people And redemption is not located under a church steeple The feeble and the meek in soul just like the technique Will inherit the earth, But the earth will be weak Mother earth in her decrepit terminal illness physique The year three thousand is bleak no happily ever after Just death following the forth right disaster, a legacy of bastards With plastic explosives your futures been eroded Cause you forgot that when your free it's multiplied indefinitely By the struggle that be the struggle I see To socialistically united the third world countries Expose hypocrisy in Americas democracy Sloppily obsessed with stopping me cause I speak prophecy Trample and dismantle your capitalist philosophy The same way I stomp the conquering rap monopoly And I'm not a fucking prophet But that's the fucking prophecy The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Vol. 1 Song: No Mercy Typed by: delnegro@mail2hiphop.com [Louis Farrakhan talking] "Brothers and sisters...friends....and I see some enemies.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that this money, which is in the billions, is coming from your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of our national product, which is of course cocaina, cocaine. Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the same time, we are doing business with the very same goverment that is flooding our streets with cocaine. Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other characters that are involved in this tragic comedy. [Beat starts] [Two Men Speak in Spanish] 1st man: Oigan ustedes ahi! Ustedes trabajando!

And the more that mc's, producers, dj's and independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality of what their contribution to the business of hiphop is rather then just the music - the more the industry will be forced to change Oh , heh, and one last thing; You don't have to agree with everything I've said But don't ever be condescending to me Picking up your wack ass friends that rhyme and being like 'Ow yeah, Immortal Technique - he's aaiight' No nigga..

It has begun The beginning of the end Yeah.. Yeah... yeah, yeah [Verse 1] The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist Forgetting God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran They bombed innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemmings I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy Conservative political right wing, ideology Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation Got my back to the wall, cause I'm facin' assassination Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave? Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves Corporate America, dancin' offbeat to the rhythm You really think this country, never sponsored terrorism?

Read about the history of the place that we live in And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children [Verse 2] Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage The brink of holy war, bottled up, like a miscarriage Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension And they refuse to even mention, European intervention Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams U.S. manufactured missles, and M-16's Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams Media censorship, blocking out the video screens A continent of oil kingdoms, bought for a bargain Democracy is just a word, when the people are starvin' The average citizen, made to be, blind to the reason A desert full of genocide, where the bodies are freezin' And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom Cause you fucked the Middle East, and gave birth to a demon It's open season with the CIA, bugging my crib Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live I'm tryin' to give the truth, and I know the price is my life But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique Who beheaded the President, and the princes and sheiks You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God Bitch niggaz scared of the truth, when it looks at you hard [Hook] It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change They wanna rearrange the whole point of view in the ghetto The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle A bandana full of glittering, generality Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality? Martial law is coming soon to the hood, to kill you While you hanging your flag out your project window [Talking] Yeah.. The fourth branch of the government AKA the media Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials As if their opinion was at all unbiased A machine shouldn't speak for men So shut the fuck up you mindless drone! And you know it's serious When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign To try to convince you they're fair and balanced When they're some of the most ignorant, and racist people Giving that type of mentality a safe haven We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards!

Yea... Ay yo The things I've seen in life will make you choke by suprise Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes Provoking my demise, I'll leave your spirit broken inside Like the feeling of 50 million people hoping you'd die And niggaz wonder why my heary is filled of hatred an anger Cause some bitch killed my first born song with a coat hanger I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty was cold Crippled and worthless, so I thought that it could never be sold My mother told me that placing my faith in God was the answer But then I hated God cause he gave my mother cancer Killing us slow like the Feds did to the Blank Panthers The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion Carefully hidden, woven into the holidays of a Christain I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me And this is prophecy, the words that I speak from my lungs The severed head of John the Baptist speaking in tongues Like "Cheke vara" my soliloquies speak to a gun Paint in slow motion like trees that reach for the sun Nigga the preaching is done cause I don't got a DJ Like Reverond Run, I curse the life of any man who kills Benevolent ones, I never asked to be the messenger But I was chosen to speak the words of every African slave Dumped in the ocean, stolen by America Tortured, buried, and frozen written out of the history books Your children are holding, internally bleeding, cold blooded Stripped of emotion, I go through the motions, but there's no Life in my eyes, it's like I'm hooked up to a respirator Waiting to die, hooked up to the fucking chair Waiting to fry, sooth an electrocution currently used In my execution, producing thoughts at the speed of light Burning confusion, I'm loosing my sight, breathing is tight The evening is white, I made my peace with the Lord and now I Stand on his right..

These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing Dying on the inside, internally bleeding Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing Dying on the inside, internally bleeding Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: Revolutionary Volume 2 Song: Cause of Death Typed by: VeinzFAQ@yahoo.com [Talking] Immortal Technique Revolutionary Volume 2 Yeah, broadcasting live from Harlem, New York Let the truth be known..

runnin' ladies married to men who dont please 'em, dreamin' of comin' urbanly murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin' Some cowards on the internet didn't think I would sell scared to talk shit in person, cuz they stuck in a shell and couldn't understand the pain of being stuck in a cell Hell is not a place you go, if you not a christian it's the failure of your lifes greatest ambition It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion I don't see the difference in between the raw and the wrong Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms I'm just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb Humanity is gone, smoked up in a gravity bong by a democrat republican Cheech and Chong Immortal Technique, you never heard me preachin' a song I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back and shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack And since life is a gamble like the crabstables at Vegas I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages [Verse 2] I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be as if our peoples history started with slavery Painfully I discovered the shit they kept

becoming a college graduate Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid The type of latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire Disciplined, intellectual beauty's what I desire Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless At first I just thought, she didn't mess with broke kids The thug niggaz always talking about, how they smoke kids But the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play "I'm not even interested" is what her body language would say Everyone around the way, gave up trying to get in it It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it On the block, bitches was jealous, but wouldn't admit it Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it 'Cause they regreted the long list of niggaz that they let hit it And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick Smoking weed with thoughts of envy, whenever they lit it She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy But when they tried to use her vocab, they sounded sloppy She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure [Hook - Jean Grae] Don't you know that, time waits for no man Not fate, it's all planned I'm blessed just to know you To be loved and to love, just to hold you all night Can't find, a reason why God came, to you and I If I had the chance again, I'd never let you go Hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know [Verse 2] Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad That I wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute I didn't have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours On her birthday, I gave her a poem with flowers Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower We talked about, power to the people and such We spent more time together but it was never enough I never tried to sneak a touch, or even cop a feel I was too interested, in keeping it real Perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me "carino," And never Technique, bought me a new book to read every 2 or 3 weeks Forever changing the expression of my thoughts when I speak It was because of her, I even deaded all of my freaks She convinced me, to stop hangin' out on the streets To stop robbin' and stealin', from people like you Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronxu We sailed in Barrio (?) and the Metropolitan too Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew So I decided one day, to tell her my feelings was true I couldn't live without her so I told her, facing my fears But honey's only response, was a face full of tears She could only sob hysterically, holding me tight I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night [Hook] [Verse 3] I went on with my life, college and my career Ended up locked up like an animal for a year Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer came back, in tact and on track But the fact of the matter, is I still felt cold Even after my mother, hugged me, cryin' at home My real niggaz would catch me thinkin', out of my zone Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone Relatively well-known around the New York underground But I kept thinking of her and how we used to be down The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair Though gone physically, somehow it was still there I had to do something, because the shit was too much to bear So I went and visited the building where she used to live The world looks a lot different after you do a bid The way your life done changed While primitive minds (are) still stuck in the same game Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin' cocaine Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up, like a mother oughta But her facial expression changed, when I asked about her daughter [Hook] [Verse 4] She told me that there was a note for me, that was left behind She had left it there waiting, for such a long time I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first I saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed She told me where the letter was and I started thinking the worst Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door And sure enough there was an envelope with my name on the floor "Nobody loves you more than me carino" is what the letter said "By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead But when you left in '97 a part of me went to Heaven I thank God at least I got to know what love really was But it hurt me, to see what true love really does 'Cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave You made me doubt the way I thought, you made me want to believe And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be Baby don't you see, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV Hoped the end exists for me since late in 1993 I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you Promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me" What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur But I remember wishing that I was dead, instead of her She was buried on August 3rd The story ends without a sequel And now you know why Technique, don't fucking fall in love with people Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you Appreciate them to the fullest extent, and then

So cut off my head, and make me a martyr. The people will allways remember it.  No, they will forget. [Immortal Technique] A man who walks with God... can walk anywhere Hence, I fear nothing (yeah!) The point of Guerrilla war is not to succeed It's always been just to make the enemy bleed Depriving the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need Bullets are hard to telegraph, when they bob and they weave (Watch~!) The only way a guerrilla war can ever be over is when the occupation can't afford more soldiers Until they have to draft the last of you, into the service And you refuse cause you don't see the purpose The only way to counter the insurgents that are well equipped (how?) is to paint the people fighting for freedom as terrorists Then find a faction looking for foreign investment Install them in power and murder any objections You can't stop a revolution from breathing So to beat 'em they offer people the illusion of freedom But when you're done dreaming and wake up tortured for treason then you can see them hiding behind the God they believe in! Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war that's the place a martyr is born (motherfucker it's on!) During the night before the start of the dawn that's the place a martyr is born (motherfucker it's on!) When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm that's the place a martyr is born (motherfucker it's on!) Guerrilla war when the army is gone That's the place a martyr is born (motherfucker it's on!) [Immortal Technique] The purpose of life is a life with a purpose So I'd rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless I don't need the circus or the day of national observance I need you to think for you and stop being a servant Pawns only move a square in the game that they're used to And realize it too late, like the shooting of Huey Newton or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allender Slaughtered by the power hungry branches of their own gente Ghandi wasn't killed, by Pakistani nationals He was assassinated by a Hindu radical And Che Guevara rebel to a U.S. continent was sold to the C.I.A. by Bolivian communists Wasn't Itzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist and Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence? Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the FBI but to blast him they used Muslims from the NOI Even the 35th President of the Republic was murdered by factions of his own government So now that it's proven that a soldier of revolution or head of an empire disguised in the constitution cannot escape the retribution or manipulation of the self-appointed rulers of the planets corporations So I'ma need every generation to put your hands up Cause you can only get 'em off your back when you stand up! [Immortal Technique] I was a man, blessed by God to survive... some of the worst circumstances I had many things: a beautiful woman I loved a home, money... and I gave it all up to bleed and to die free Sometimes I look back on that life and I wonder what it would have been like In the moments of weakness I think about trading it But then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality and I realize.. that I've been the heart of a war And that's the place a martyr is born The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique f/ Bazaar Royale, Dead Prez Album: The Martyr Song: Angels & Demons Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [dialogue from "In the Line of Fire"] What do you see when you're in the dark, and the Demons come?

Uhh I'm like the birth of baby Mohammed The movement I started could spar with the hardest a martyr regarded as spartic dishearted It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest when you're a target in an Afghan Teutoburg forest Close quarters combat, over corrupted elections Bilderberg is like cancer, it grows with infection Nepotism is the gold in the conductors connection And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in The military ain't there for the peoples protection they're just there to protect an investment That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested Connected streets are infested, with those tired of protesting Traumatized children grown in guerilla garrisons 9/11 generations pale in comparison And you will learn a lesson repeated through history that no matter what you think, occupation is not victory~!

[Immortal Technique] Here's a toast to the dead; if you don't drink, smoke to the head For the freedom fighters killed by the Feds For those who died hard in the streets, soakin in red And died slow asleep in a dream, chokin in bed Here's a toast to the dead, for my enemies that have gone I'm not a coward, so, celebrating that would be wrong I pray to God that your soul'll come back again So I can see you in the next life and finish it then A toast to the dead, for criminals, burning in hell I wonder how many Presidents are burning as well Emperors, popes, senators, generals Amputees feelin lucky until they see the vegetables A toast to the dead, for those who are forgotten Written out of the history by the corrupted and rotten Black saints whitewashed during La Reconquista Thousands of Indio-Spaniards used to conquer the Incas Fuck a moment of silence, I need a moment of violence like the nineteenth-century Caribbean Islands Long love those who came before, that paved the way for me The warriors and scientists that came before slavery And if that last lyric was predictable, well take that clairvoyance and apply it to life in the physical Presumptuous, half-hearted homunculus Self-destruction is the power, without knowin what the function is [Immortal Technique] Here's a toast to the dead, for all of my fam I will never let an idea die with a man My rhymes are like Nazca lines, designed to give a view of this J Dilla's still alive as long as his music is A toast to the dead, for rap legends and pioneers Your legacy, won't be forsaken as long as I am here Knowledge of the past and, wisdom of the present I'll teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant A toast to the dead, for children with cancer and AIDS A cure exists and you probably coulda been saved Sad to see medicine divorce morality Corporate home-wreckers pimpin up a salary A toast to the dead, for those, that'll die today For victims of those exonerated by DNA The only thing worse than giving freedom to the guilty is killing the innocent and leaving your soul filthy Immortal Technique, remember me when I'm gone I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in the song So you'll always keep a piece, of my spirit inside when you struggle to complete what I started before I died But some of you won't survive the changes the Earth makes Swallowed by tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes And that's just the first stage if you cannot reverse ways and realize that we are one, regardless of our birthplace [Immortal Technique] My last toast to the dead is for the listener Human being or extraterrestrial visitor Remember us for more than our primitive ways when you study us long after the end of our days...

[Immortal Technique] YEAH; I survived the CoIntelPro assassinations AIDS epidemic, crack era, fractured a nation The interpretation of American democracy is best exemplified, in its foreign policy dichotomy I live a double life of political philosophy But revolution follows me, the struggle for equality against the morally bankrupt, claiming to be born again It's a civil war again like MS-13's origin Ban ethnic studies claiming our culture will swallow them But you can't conquer people and build a country on top of them and then feel offended that they breathe the same oxygen Your family values lack the wisdom of Solomon But Operation Condor and Operation Bootstrap are Poli Sci 101, research for the new jacks It's hard to reach, communist utopia tomorrow when your hands are in a fuckin glass jar like Che Guevara Forget the distorted historical facts you were given Slave trade was the capital for capitalism Trapped in a prison, mentally, dying existentially Separated from people you can't see yourself to be then racially integrated into a burning house Colony of an empire, economically burning out Can't win a debate, so they sponsor every threat to me I wonder if Agent 800 is standing next to me [Outro] In Puerto Rico, the main problem we have es que somos colonia We are a colony, we are fighting for freedom because we will not be a slave nation forever The struggle here is to make universities The struggle here is in the community It's against the police and violence It's against discrimination, it's against the crime against humanity on this beautiful Caribbean Island This is Palabras, peace and que alda Young Lords, revolutionary always From San Juan, Puerto Rico Que viva Puerto Rico libre The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique Album: The Martyr Song: Ultimas Palabras Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Immortal Technique] A new American revolution has begun Not against the forces of a colonial kingdom but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us It is not a foreign invasion we have to fear rather the threat of a force within our nation that has usurped what was once a dream of having the greatest democracy ever known to man We now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially and the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all We in the inner city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos may not realize it yet, but make no mistake~! The people who control the technology and run every enterprise that makes up our world have seen this coming for a long time The ideas of renewable energy, global warming the idea of collectively working were purposefully bought out, derailed, demonized, or corrupted in favor of an economic structure, designed by a monetary caste system In a desperate attempt to convince us that we need to maintain that extravagant existence they've pretended we might share in their dream that we can justify any inhumanity in its name Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery Many of the founders of this nation were themselves Masons That is not a left-wing or a right-wing conspiracy theory it is a widely known and accepted fact So then explain to me how a nation founded by men who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe but also that of Africa, could permeate such a lie in convincing the American public that one race of men was superior, and one inferior when in fact we know that all the early men the people who created civilization every aspect of what we see today the foundation of all modern human life, were from Africa The greatest cowardice of course came not with, slavery itself unfortunately but with the excuses for slavery For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire and all other empires that have come after her and claimed "No we were just stronger, and that's why we took you" then when slavery was over, racism would have probably followed in suit But instead it was the social lie, the religious lie that was told, that stayed in the minds of people that separated one human being from another in order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom they created issues around religion and race to dominate the world for centuries to come Some claim, that they respect the culture of life in this country They cry out for the indignity of children that are slaughtered before they are born But God has not penetrated their souls For they have no empathy; nothing in their cold hearts for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas for that which they call "collateral damage" which are the burnt and damaged children of world They have no prayers for them Only snide commentary on the internet, and laughter in their hearts And yet you claim to be one with God? Heh We talk about immigration in this country Might doesn't make right ladies and gentlemen it just makes right now What we are saying to the rest of the world is one day when America grows weak One day when her legions falter on a day when her economy crumbles China, Russia, Europe, whatever power has arisen All you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions and then you too can set up shop here, and in 100 years you can tell every red-blooded American "No! You are an illegal human being!  I am the true citizen! I have all the rights! You have no rights!" Maybe you forgot how you got this country Maybe you take for granted the blood, the sweat, the tears that the people who live in practical serfdom, shed everyday for we may not run America, but we make America run We talk about the law; yet how many indignities have been legal in the past? How many treaties with Native American people have we broken? How many international laws have we violated? And, speaking of laws how can a corporation be regulated by a government that is funded and controlled by corporations? How can there be accountability for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans? Above the lives of human beings in other countries? We have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines My words, of course, will be marginalized, demonised in typical fashion Any time you dare to question the power structure they say "You hate America" No~! I love this country I see its beauty everyday in its people and I love it a lot more than those that have abandoned the American worker that have chose to exploit and try and take away every single benefit that she has Those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed in the name of supposed freedom Those who demand accountability from everyone but often none themselves Who favor contracts over lives Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas The greatest flaw, that any intelligent person has is to think that they're smarter than everyone else And so, as the government has planted its spies amongst us we have planted our spies among them They have infiltrated every branch of the American government They have retrieved names, data, hard numbers, the paper trail that will expose those that truly control this country Those that, control the political parties those that control the oil industry, the energy Those that stand behind the companies - faceless whose names have never been revealed until tod.. {*gunshot, people screaming in panic*} {*a young man yells "DAD!!" repeatedly*} {*a heart slowly stops beating*} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Immortal Technique f/ Lockjaw Nakai, Cetan Wanbli, Dr. Cornel West Album: The Martyr Song: Sign of the Times Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Native rhythmic chant by Lockjaw Nakai, Cetan Wanbli until 0:48] [Immortal Technique] The fuck is goin on~?

I guess the fortune tellers skipped an anti-Christ or two Brothers give this to the O.G.'s doin life with you and pray for the problems, with the Pope psychology so the Vatican will offer an apology (for what!?) For destroying the people's liberation theology Snatchin the spirit of Jesus from people in poverty Business decisions, like keepin people in prison but had the opposite effect, incarcerating religion That type of crooked politics imposed on the populace is obvious, if you read the Northwood Documents Forget the compliments, for what I recorded (yeah) and live for Revolution, instead of always dying for it! Remember a bullet can never stop me (never!) My legions are led by the spirit of Haile Selassie, watch me Even if I'm shot in the chakra, I will prosper Doppler effect, bumping music out a helicopter Telling the Persians "Dig up Zoroastra" And Tell them I came back, as the son of Ahura MazdÄ Fish out the Philistine, Dagon, from the shores of Gaza And call Quetzalcoatl, flying over La Raza This is my message to the older Gods I sacrifice you all, to the revolution like the Romanovs Lost in the desert, like the Hebrews of Israel The blood clot system, tryiedto kill me like sickle cell But I survived and I'm alive to fight another day Cocooned in a coma, I can still hear my mother pray Sister crying out to God, "Please let my brother stay!"

War brought to you by the big corporate-masters who run the show This isn't just a War on Iraqis or Afghanis or Arabs, or even Muslims It is ultimately a War on us all! That's because the billions and billions that are being spent on this War the cost of tanks, rocketry, bullets and yes even salaries for the 125,000 plus troops, is money that will never be spent on; education, on healthcare, on the reconstruction of crumbling public housing or to train and place the millions of workers who have lost manufacturing jobs in the past three years alone The War in Iraq is in reality; a war against the nations' workers and the poor who are getting less and less while the big Defense industries and making a killing – literally! What's next Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela? We've already seen the corporate media play megaphone to the White House, to build and promote a War based on lies War is utilized by the imperialists first and foremost, to crush internal enemies We're seeing the truth of its insight when we see the sad state of American education the rush of seniors to buy affordable medications from the Canadians because American drugs are just too expensive the threat of privatization of Social Security and the wave of repression that comes with an increasing Militarized Police; this is a War on all of us And the struggle against War is really a struggle for a better life for the millions of folks who are in need here in this country!

odds against me, are crooked and impossible Like I was born with a hole in my heart is an obstacle I was left to die by the doctors, in the Children's Hospital But I never lose hope, success is psychological The world is volatile and the street is my education Shaping the nation, like the blueprint of a mason While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion So I'm focused on my economic situation I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh A lot of niggaz drop science but they dont know the math Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path It's funny how on the block niggaz will kill you for cash But never raise the gun and cry out "Freedom at last" The cold war is over but the world is still gettin colder Atlas walking through the projects with the hood on my shoulders I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers But then the general, would decide when their life would be over So I work hard until my personality split Like the black panthers, into the bloods and the crips They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminice Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin through Genesis Ignorance is venemous, and it murders the soul Spreading like a virus running rampant, but out of control [Hook] So if I should ever fall and get caught in a hustle Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble Spray painting on the streets and at the subway tunnels Write it down and remember that we never gave in The mind of a child is where the revolution begins So if the solution has never been to look in yourself How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else [Verse 2] Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin cracks in a duffle Upstate behind steel gates intact in the scuffle Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils, hacked to your muscle But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you And its the lawyers, not the inmates scheming to fuck you Trying to fight the system from inside, eventually corrupts you But thats what you get when you put a corporation above you And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most Sometimes when they die you find yourself cursing their ghost But you make success, nobody delivers your fate Sometimes you give and you take Since prehistoric vertibrates, crawled out of the lakes And thats the truth about life Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice Because even though we survived through the struggle that made us We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us But I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges And semi-automatic barrages, that empty the cartridge Post-traumatically scar kids that try to be brave Because niggaz backstab each other just to try to get paid Turn cannibal like nights during the crusades Afraid of responsibility; addicted to greed Beating their girls purposefully losing a seed As if we were bound to the destiny we used to recieve [Hook] I used to wonder (I used to wonder) about people who don't believe in themselves But then I saw the way that they portrayed us to everyone else That cursed us, then only see the worst in ourselves blind to the fact the whole time we were hurting ourselves I used to wonder (I used to wonder) about people who don't believe in themselves But then I saw the way that they portrayed us to everyone else That cursed us, then only see the worst in ourselves blind to the fact the whole time we were hurting ourselves I used to wonder {*echo*}
