The names have been changed to protect the innocent ones not involved in the stories I'm about to tell. So  listen up and listen up well. Here are the true accounts and incidents  and still to me, it makes no sense. Ignorance is a major role, but  here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more.  Verse One: Frost Homicide, on the murder scene Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying Victim: a young product of the project system The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him True, a few may stand in disbelief, but The majority will sigh a relief Because of the fact he was a menace to society And gang violence was his first priority So, now you take a look to see what this abouta Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay, Another typical day in the streets of L. A.  Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene Verse Two: Frost Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave The violent death, it took place at around six And eyewitnesses say that it went like this,  There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally Sally had just got off the bus from a job, When she met three young thugs who decided to rob A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out And when he came across the scene, He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late The thugs started blastin' Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do? If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue? My man, he tried, that's hwo he died He was shot right between the eyes Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family Homicide on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder  scene  Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Ho-Homicide on the murder scene Break it down!

Every Saturday he's playing ball with his little boy And raising him the right way Showing him a way out you might say You see, you're never too old to learn So just sit back and listen as I take my turn If I could make this world perfect I would, but I can't And I still got nothing but love for the hood [Chorus x2] [Frost] Population 69,000 Now that's a whole lot of people that my hood be housing Most of them are happy, make the best from the worst But you be trying to act like the ghetto is cursed Now check it, little kids playing out in the park Mama yelling out their name when it gets dark An old man, he takes out his garbage cans And then he turns with a smile to shake the next man's hand And all I see is love and sensitivity But if the government could, then they'd get rid of me But now I sure am glad that I was brought up strong Now let me tell you, mama brought the Frost up with values And if you fall, then I'ma be the first one to help you out And see, you thought I was the worst one If I could make this world perfect I would, but I can't And I still got nothing but love for the hood [Chorus x2] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Frost f/ Rich Garcia Album: Smile Now, Die Later Song: La Raza II (Cantina Remix) Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com It's all goin down this year My Lac's in gear and I wiped off my tattoo tears A lot of things have changed since '90 I got a lot more homeboys and gente behind me And this time you just can't stop it No tellin' what might happen When your kids get a copy of the '95 remix We in the casa, we did it for La Raza Because it's all brand new, it's updated You see my Cherokee's a Lac And my spokes are gold plated I'm hitting side to side There's a lump in my throat But I just can't swallow my Brown Pride I'm like an eagle with a snake in his mouth And a brown fist represents Frost in the house Coming back hard on the rap scene It's all about the red, white, and green Yeah [Chorus: Rich Garcia (Frost)] If you're chicano and you're brown and proud It's your kind of music (This is for the Raza) And If you're down for your neighborhood It's your kind of music (Chicano, and I'm brown and I'm proud) Here I go again, and I'm bound to win Because I'm proud of the color of my skin You see I'm kinda like De La Hoya I'm filled with the spirit of an Aztec Warrior And that means you better not mess with me This is Frost, the capital E-S-E I'm hitting switches like back in the video I'm that same fool that you seen five years ago I still cruise, I paid my dues And the only thing new is some more tattoo It's that Mexican sound, that makes it brown I'm stomping in my Nikes and I'm all creased down Out in El Paso, up through Chicago Even in Manhattan they begging for a Latin Cities like Miami is waiting for another jam I rocked Mexico but called it the Motherland Yeah Man, I think I came up with a solution And the answer is Brown Revolution So pump your fist to this And wave your Mexican flag And be proud that your khaki's sag I'm here to set the record straight And clean up the slate All player haters headed upstate They hate to see me bouncing through East Los Or cooling in my house on the hill on the West Coast Or hanging with the veterano OG's And hearing all the stories of the '70's Like how the boulevard used to be And how they had values in '73 But now I'm living in a new era And surviving in the '90's is sheer terror Some of you don't know what's happening, ¿Que pasa?

know you need me}  Sexy lady  {do you really want me, do you really need me}  [Verse One] Can you remember when I told you that you rock my world  but you was young and you was daddy's little diamond girl  I can't forget the day when you was posted up at school  With your home girls and I was scooping up my crew  You was only seventeen and I felt a fool  Cuz seventeen could get a homie twenty-two  That couldn't stop me from having fantasy  and made me wounder, we could sail the seven seas  and I was fiending fo ya, I was dreaming fo ya  but then I heard the news you was leaving California  On the way to college for an education  and I was happy for you, gave you my congratulations  Situation under mind, we said good bye  You was the only girl to ever make me cry  Yo, if I send a dozen roses they would probably die  From all the tear drops and I can't even lie  [Chorus 2X] Your a good girl now  Your were daddy's little girl {yes I'm ready}  Can I hold you {yes I'm ready}  Your a good girl now  You were daddy's little girl {yes I'm ready}  Wrap your arms around me {yes I'm ready}  [Verse Two] They was telling me you doing good and working hard  but as for me steady huslin on the boulevard  Sometimes I catch my self In a memory bliss  Just thinking about you and the way you blew your kiss  With your big brown eyes and them candy lips  They way you did your hair running down your hips  but you was raised with them good old fashion ways  and never gave a damn if I was getting paid  You made your own life and you were doing right  Look at all the negativity you had to fight  and that's the type of women any man will get on his knees  Burning beggin please I loved it when you teased me  but I was raised on streets and I'm makin moves  Even thought you knew the things I do you disaproved of  I hope you doing well, it's kinda hard to tell  Every single day you got me checking on my mail  [Chorus 2X] [Frost talking] yea what's up girl  I heard you was coming home soon  I hope it's true  yea we got a lot to talk about  and I can't wait to see you  call me  You said you ready baby {I'm ready}  You said you want me girl {I want you}  You said you need me {I really really need you}  I'll make you feel right  [Verse Three] Since you been away I'm praying for a better way  and I've been searching for it every single day now  Hoping for a second chance maybe another dance  Used to be a player now I'm fiending for a romance  I must apologize to you in my heart and soul  I gotta say it's been a thrill for me to watch you grow  I know you ready fo the, I

ya I hope it don't get ya mad when we get richer {*beat changes*} [Verse 4: Frost] Why's that dark cloud over my head I think it's gonna rain I could feel the pain Of all the people that I hurt for financial gain And bad thoughts got me thinking that I've gone insane I gotta make the great escape and get away from it all To a city, where there ain't no Pain at all Take medicine from the earth to relieve my mind Of all the pressures that I got from my daily grind Cause nowadays, it's a trip, you can't only rhyme You gots to kill for the scrill and scrap for nickels and dimes And that's on everything I love, yes, it's a true plain fact That ever since La Raza still stay packed I roll around in my low, windows tinted black Slang everythang to weed Speed and crack My pockets stay swoll and I'm always tact Stepped away from the scene, but knew I'd always come back Why ya all played catch up Just tryin' to match up To the man in the myth, you failed drastically And plus those record

Still Up in This Shit Song: Para Mi Abuelita Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com Yeah During the making of this cd I lost a few loved ones And one of my family members that was very dear to me Was my abuelita Amilia I'll remember you forever There will never be another one like you, no never As I think about your smile and reminice for a while You taught me so many things when I was a young child I remember growing up when things would get tough You would do anything to come cheer me up We would talk, hold hands at the beach in the sand Those are the memories I have as an older man You and all your beautiful flowers in the backyard for hours And my grandpa with a cigar building a bike For any kid who didn't have a new one to ride He loved my grandma and he devoted his life To the lady he loved his beautiful wife, my abuelita I will love you abuelita I promise forever And I can't wait for the day to see you and grandpa together And should a rainy day come I won't give it a chance

down Take the fattest little bully and I'd always knock him down You better run, and teachers used to think that I was dumb After school, at the store, I'm jacking candy and gum As a teen, I turned it into vodka and rum I got popped at fifteen and did a year for a gun While I was bustin', that was when I started writing songs And it seems like I gotta do, I gotta do wrong Chorus: Bobby "Seems like

[Chorus 2X: Frost] L.A. should be crazy-Ass-Place to stay where the rider die and players play I've been around the world and around the way 24/7 like every way [Verse 2: Frost] I see the clock strike half past I'm movin' fast, quick to blast I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path And everybody's out to get me So I quickly stick and move And if he moves I trip, my finger's itchy I got a vision, I'm on a mission Listen, I can hear them but I can't trust my intuition I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical And through the darkness, I'm hoping for a miracle I can't holler till you hear me I gotta get me through the madness even though I'm guilty And as I reload I'm all alone set to explode Like a pathological murderer that's in the zone I know the working, the spirit's lurking I'm hurting, the triple six with the kiss got my soul searching When I awoke I choked on a cloud of smoke It was a dream and in my dream, I seen a black crow... [Break: Frost Talking] another day in L.A. comes to an end the dark of the nights starts to set in lots of peers going down under the seek lights [Verse 3: KM.G] Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag And my homies still reying on the flag Yeah, life starts to twist and turn And it hits you at another angle Just some more drama in the City Of Angels Violence is brought forth through many years Broken memories, we cried so many tears Ooh the Devil plays the repo man And he's sucking up souls As fast as he can It ain't no question It's in our nature A 45 brings out the criminal behaviour When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room Your heart starts to beat, it's like the ritual And the feeling that you get is somewhat spiritual I'mma have to let you know how reality goes Makes you fly like the Crow as you slide into limbo...
