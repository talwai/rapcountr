Is this shit gonna kill me, man? No, no son. No need to panic. It's actually quite good for you. It slows down the structure of white blood cells And cures the flow. It's called nature's illing leaf.

Verse 3: Just another day Another fat sweet to get my head right I'm sitting back, my windows cracked I'm chilling at the red light Minding my business But why is this law typing my plates I only gotta dime and ain't got time to catch no case But still she races up to me And stick her nose out in my car "Hey bitch, what you looking in my car for?" She pointed at the sweet Still burning and said, "Aw" I had to think quick Pulled out my dick And shoved it in her jaw But like weak times I had to hit the gas Collect my seeds Clean the ash Non-stop, evade the cops They mad because I'm high they not I made the block, screwed up some cop Dipped back on the freeway Threw my empty 40 bottle out When I passed San Felipe We stay blowed, fucked up, drunk, full, bent My kids screaming Astroworld But all my time is spent And you can tell the way I smell My braincells ain't shit From all the weed and all the alcohol But y'all, I can't quit (2 guys talking) That was cool, man. Hey, can I get one of those dranks? Naw, man. I told you about your beer-hoggin' ass. Nigga, go to the fuckin' store. C'mon, man. Can I drink with y'all, man? I can't hear.

My mistake, I didn't hear. What you say? Oh yeah, it is, a nice day." And then a fine gal start walkin' With a sway in her hips And a lot of gloss on her lips She started to trip and said, "Nigga where you been? He look just like you and he damn near ten." And my gal gave me an evil...kind of grin And then she said, "Have you ever been in.. A girl like that?" Yo, I couldn't pretend I tried to tell her the truth but I didn't know what to do But [Devin & Girlfriend talking] What? (What was that all about? And who was that you was talkin' to?) Who?

[Verse Three] Yeah, I fucked up so I figured that I'd take her On a nice vacation, uh huh the island of Jamaica With the wonder weather, exotic creatures and birds Trees we've never seen a lot of creatures and herbs So landed safely and we bailed off the plane What the hell is that smell man? Damn, something like a paper mill, oh well let the day begin Escorted out the van I grabbed the hand of my lady friend Goin' sight seein', I might be in luck Seems that she forgot that I've been fuckin' up We jumped out the van Our toes hit the sand My lady's lookin' so fine and people know I'm her man I let go of her palm to find a tree so we can rest She kept walkin', sayin' she'd be back in about an hour or less Two hours later and with a muscle bound Jamaican They woke me up talkin' 'bout "Your spot has been taken mon Take your ass back to the states This woman belongs to me now."

out this reefer 'bout an hour and it sounds so soothin  It's kinda hard to write this one and keep the track movin  Barbeque with weed and brew is how we usually do it  Get it dumpin while we pumpin up some good music  Can't afford to lose it, hobbied to a full-time job  Keep my track record clean for those who wanna pull my card  It's kinda hard on a brotha with the struggle and all  But all I can say is just keep hustlin and y'all  Got to love it live it, ya can't be in it for nothin  'Cause there's too many niggas out there who witness this shit,  it's not fair  Nobody to blame for your misfortune and fame  Just tryna' take the right road, please, call Jermaine  I've seen rain, but now it's pourin  And at least I gotta have a Sweet when I wake in the mornin  So let's just all do our thing like an orchestra does  Pass the shit around so we can all get a buzz  (Chorus)  (David Banner)  I can't blame it on my mama, nigga I knew she was broke  No education so she spent the last check on some dope  Hovers to John's and my father never seen the funds  But I heard he was locked in jail keep his nuts on his tongue  Who gives a fuck, the government can lick the sweat off my dick  They put crack off in the hood and lock us up when we trip  A little dough, ask them hoes what they put in here for  I heard birds fly through the wind, then they land at your door  Hot sex all night until my body gets numb  I'm too nervous to relax so I bail when I come  Can't get alone with my folks so I dump on them fools  Basketball is all they taught a young nigga in school  Fuck your foot, and your basket, you can lick on my balls  My school don't have the internet so I stuff crack in my draws  And if y'all know a better way, then y'all help me escape  From this hell that I live everyday  (Chorus)  (Kamikaze)  Dear Lord, please forgive me, I've sinned against your land  I've lived this life so hella trife in this pursuit of loot and fame  You saw your child weapin on his knees at night in vein  And it's a way from tryna' get off in this game  But if it's all the same, can I digress, I've struggled, nonetheless  Make my first mistake of learnin how to drink and smoke the cess  Did my best to tread water but it was just as I feared  At the time I needed friends that was the time they disappeared  See I got jeered in every corner, couldn't hang 'cause I was broke  Thought he had a record deal, it seemed to be the runnin joke  And it's just enough to drive a soul of man to drink and smoke  Just enough to make a college grad go out and sell dope  And it was never "how ya doin", never "can I help"  "Can I share this wealth", I guess I have to make it by myself  Could it be the situation came from dirt that I had done  Havin no earthly idea where my next dollar's comin from  Didn't give a damn if daddy all alone up in this world  Didn't care anotha nigga had helped to feed my baby girl  Didn't care that Kamikaze just broke down from all the stress  Wasn't there at six that mornin, when my car got reposessed  I thought y'all was my homies, but I guess it's just as well  You left sho' 'nuff, you're rock bottom and I'm a let y'all burn in hell  You're bitches  (Chorus

writing rhymes with a tall cup  The speakers banging, the whole room fogged up  Sour diesel in the morning, for my stress ways  Get a sip of O.G., for my best days  Cloud nine, on the stage homie start the show  I hear them voices in my head, saying please let go  Slow it down, put my habits on cruise control  But I'm hustling, need something to sooth the soul  Rest in peace, to them boys who got a lullaby  God forgive me, I'm still here riding high  [Devin the Dude]  I creep you by death slow, I got weed in my whip so  I'm constantly rolling and smoking, but I seldom slip though  Inside

bring friends  Light up an inscent, but the weed gon' blast through  Cause everybody got a different, kind of what have you  We hitting it getting it in, shit's in the wind  When you try to give up, somebody fire up again  And you can't pretend, when the weight is on your shoulder  And you start getting older, and feel you need to hold up  You can grow up, but never grow old  And let go, when you ain't having fun no mo'  Nigga chill, better live until you die  That's why, I'm riding high  [Verse 3]  Chasing down that money  Days ain't always sunny, I get by  Trying to stay in the zone  In a

She made me sick some time I just had to fuck this bitch one time I met her in the galleria shopping, buying  Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that But man she had an ass so fat You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants Walked behind her whispering love songs She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit And told her try it Replied, while with these light brown eyes I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size She put it on so I paid for  Then I told her she could keep it And then I walked out the store, it's our secret But peep it Made it down the hall, she came running Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning  I don it Made a mack move and girl chased me And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces It's tasteless But honey must of missed being treated Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating Her ass behind the silly shit And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this Let's see the sights, its me tonight Let's leave him stuck home pacing Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces Chorus: You must be used to all the finer thangs Infatuated by what money brangs It seems to me you hoes will never change So all that's left is for us to exchange {Too $hort} I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it They make a nigga feel like he doing something The pussy so good have you through with money But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch Quite a few niggas got the pussy But everytime I see her got to stop and look Cause she so damn fine bitch I want to make you mine bitch I want to fuck one time bitch Short Dogg's on your mind bitch I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick It make me bust this It's hard to hold back when it's this good  You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch Repeat Chorus: {Devin} Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my piss I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it  I bust 4, 5, 6 nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house I know thats my bitch And she don't tell nobody shit She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop The nut skeeted out like thick white snot She saw it was still hard and said look what I got Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces Repeat Chorus: {Tela} I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices Saying its about six or seven dime pieces We can hook up with no chains and no leashes Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin for three Nights Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized Thinking to myself at this time and realized She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my suprise Enter the room with the cat ass eyes Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit Girl stop licking right there you killing me Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P This
