A rapper's rapper, the kid can do this To you ignorant muh'fuckers, don't misconstrue this Everything reversed now, I live in _The Matrix_ So how can I stay anonymous, when it's my job to be famous? (Talk to 'em) A lot of y'all can't interpret when I'm speakin that language But some better understand to the rest it's better you can't Now when you speak of the elite, I feel honored if mentioned Because the goal is on top, never honorable mention If Joe's purpose is due, here it is it's no further anew Enough said with no further adieu I'm comin, (geah) I'm comin, I'M COMIN!

just rap it instead See I got Wolverine claws in me But the whole worlds throwin stones at me Like they all got a bone with me Got a childs mother And I hate her to death But that's my childs mother So that's my major till death Its wild how I love her For putting little me here And me and here could be forever she gon still be there but there some other niggaz I just take care of the room But they some other niggaz Now lets get back to the song I got a drug problem That I ain't attended to Because I got enough problems And my solution is to stuff problems But if something goes wrong with that Then its back to PCP And so long with raps See I'm depressed lately But nobody understands that I'm depressed lately I'm sorta feelin represed lately And youll be hearin and seein me less lately Like has anyone noticed the regress lately Look deep nigga Don't I seem stressed lately Seem disturbed Alotta regrets lately Got a company That I'm signed to But they ain't in my company When all I need is some company When I start feelin like everybodies done with me I'm tryin to see what everybody want fwith me Then the mistress Yeah the girl from *10 minutes its her Now I'm needed ten minutes for her I can't get into it But I want y'all to know That ill get into But ill save that for *The Growth And this rap beef But I'm so secure with me Its only rap beef I don't need security Wanna get at me Wanna go to war with me That's just one phone call from me Check this shit I got a whole hood That don't appreciate me It's not the whole hood That depreciates me What you gonna tell me When it's the streets that made me And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me And then theres rap critics They say all I make is dance music But to almost anything You can dance stupid They ain't like the single But they ain't cop the album Wouldn't give a chance to it Not a second glance to it They say he whines too much Hes too bitter They call it complaining I call it explaining I know normal niggaz get caught up in the game and Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment Its some shit with me And dudes been knew that But I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that And then rap ain't payin the bills Its more money more problems Or its no money more problems Its all enormous when you playin these games That's how it feel to have a warrant on a famous face Then the albums pushed back because they say he need a single at the moment When what he need is a single moment Then I'm involved in the he say she say And that's on my mind on replay each day Then theres the bullshit that she say that hes gay But she wouldn't like to think that I ain't like her Just because she was throwin it at me and I ain't touch her Shell say anything sides from I ain't wanna fuck her I don't feel good So I don't wanna go to a club dont wanna go to a lounge just wanna lounge in the same sweats that I had on for days same tee I had on for a week what I got on it speaks what I got on it reeks no shape up cause but that's just how I'm feelin and one day at a time its God willin im tryin to see straight but the fog keeps building pulse start racing the bulls startin to hate me but I gotta be a king cause its wolves tryin to play me hoodie when its hot like its freezing winter rest, starve, eat and sleep for dinner and its hard trying keep this in ya So I write it all down So one day maybe When life is all sweet ill remember Then its probation I know we all go through it We call it pro-bation But there's no pros to it And my souls aching Only a few peers know Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old I had some shit going on with my dick It felt good but its bad So I'm sitting here like what the bitch had It's not Graph, Its real Look scrappy its true Dog whats poppin Do he look happy to you Now if it goes to the wire Got the soul of a fighter Bruised up and sloppy I damage like Ali Up late talking to the fans on the website That's the only thing that send your man of to bed right FUCK THE WORLD FUCK MY MOMS AND MY GIRL Well maybe not moms Just let me remain calm This too won't last This too shall pass At least that's what I say dog That's what I pray for And I'm the only thing that's standing in my way yall But I gotta be wit me There's no escape yall I guess depression just stepped in and took over shit like its known to do I guess its that Hey Joe I'm going home with you Turn your phone off I need to be alone with you I need to be in the zone with you Cause I'm the only thing you grown to nigga Look I own you nigga Been with me since ten But you startin to confuse me Cause Its been so long You still trying to lose me Like bitch how could you show me such cruelty When everybody turns there back on you Joe it's just you and me You don't want me to see you right And why you always come see me how we reunite Tell me I know you feel for me deep in your heart Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart Now you got a deal And you wanna get rid of me But we roommates I'm in your head Joe You live with me So I don't write for the fans Nah  I write to my man And hope hell just leave and understand Like Like please leave the kid

(in that mood yet) If I died tomorrow See if I died tomorrow Yo, yo yo yo yo I woke up around nine, day felt like no other Kissed wifey on the forehead, told her that I love her Thinking as I look for where my car keys at I know it ain't promised I'll be back See if I died tomorrow Whether from a disease or from a bullet I wouldn't be mad, I lived my life to the fullest I drove cars that I never thought I would I fucked broads never thought I could See if I died tomorrow I'd be in heaven with the folk that raised me Grandma, Jimmy, Great Grandma Daisy 'Least I'd be around some people that's just like me 'Least I'd be around my Uncle Mikey If I died tomorrow I know moms would probably be hysterical For 25 years she seen me be a miracle Seen me come a long way just by being lyrical Naw I ain't act religious but God know me to be spiritual If I died tomorrow, wouldn't feel like it's wrong I ain't expect to be here this long They told me before I get 21 that they would have my grave handy Two years later, nominated for a Grammy Vibe Awards, Kev said I probably shouldn't go with him He ain't think I wouldn't make it good at the podium Fans wanting the best for me I couldn't be there as I won but ?? all my Jersey heads rep for me If I died tomorrow then what would it mean Already feel like I'm livin my dream Came across some pretty interesting folk I met some new people Ain't move alot of units, but touched a few people So I might get frustrated fuckin wit the hood son But everyday above ground is a good one Walk out the door and leave it in God's hands If I go it's just part of God's plan If I died tomorrow Will life carry out the same Well at least my little man can carry out the name And look, I can say I lived my life without stress If I died tomorrow, I'm fine I been blessed, Yes! I made some money, and true I could've had more But he's happy and what more could he ask for If it was no diamonds and no begets I still would have no worries, I got no regrets I made my mom proud, and pop feels the same way But he's a man so he probably got too much pride to say Can't count my blessings on one hand, more than a handful And God ain't send nothin my way I couldn't handle [Hook] If I know I was called to go I know one thing that's for sure I'll be alllriiight.. cuz it was my time And if its one thing that I know I don't regret one choice I chose I'm livin my life If I was gonna die tomorrow [Joe] Yo if I died tomorrow Throw a little liquor in the sky I'm good here don't ask God why, don't cry I did everything I wanted, left nothin unturned Roll sumtin, light it, let it burn If I died tomorrow...

by: JamaalMS322@yahoo.com 10-3-07 The soundtrack to my life is like CNN first shit Images like CNN but worse shit I would down the whole Pinot Gris But I'd see the Group Home without the Premo beats And it hurts my soul I'm a Warrior so though the odds is against a nigga Dirk gon choke Some people confide in the person that they sleep with Ive learned theres no such thing as a secret (oh) I can't describe the feeling I get You was riding shotgun I was wheeling the whip Shit I even let you rock out Being Bill Belichick tapin from the sidelines stealin my shit But dawg you was like a mini me Mocked me envied me turns out you was blowin hot air Kenny G But you was cool accepted you instantly Not a groupie but you had a few tendencies And though we share a few memories A couple wrong turns'll turn a friend to an enemy See phony people like phony people Even you could be mistaken if you phone these people Look when you invite the nerds to the cool table shit is bound to break up like a pool table Some wack dudes'll start feeling like the shit And you thinkin its you its really where you sit Or maybe you was neglected Cause when you take the front down and strip a nigga naked hes dying to be accepted (oh) I did that just the way you was Now you a stranger nothing like the way you was But uh you not real you not Rachel You not Worm you not Dill shit you not chill I thought you had some (?) fuck the fake shit I'm really feelin that you tryna screw me And you a lil smarter than the average dude So it took a nigga just a lil longer to see They tried to warn me fought with my girl every night about you shit only hurts cause she was right about you She run around wanting to shoot you the fair one I keep telling her chill I don't care none I got another side I never showed to you The side where everybody is disposable See relationships are never a threat Cause Ill erase the history and act like we never met Become done giving a fuck and done callin I got your e-mail I was done way before then (oh) Dear Diary I don't wanna keep shit inside of me Id rather just speak to you privately Maybe its my mood as far as I can see Theres really no point in having this guy with me Change from the days of us getting in your truck Its bigger than one song its bigger than a buck Its bigger than me bigger than buck Bigger than voodoo its bigger than luck shit its bigger than us I always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way (when) When I'm really the fool for tryna teach'em When the blinds leading the blind you can't reach'em If niggas aint as hungry as you then why feed'em Niggas aint tryna be lead then why lead'em Having big problems with your dogs why breed'em Ill keep my part up keep my guard up Was like Thundercats but changed faster than Cheetara Just a small part of a larger issue Sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to But we all equal no one lower or above me I love my team just as much as they love me If not more If I turn the knob we all going through the door I aint coming back for yall The whole crew feel the same as me How could you ignore something so plain to see I'm being ig'nant that get on my nerves every minute What's plain to some is really Burberry printed Being so real sometimes is a slow kill We was one squad you broke out like Mike Schofield I want fillet mignon you want oatmeal Add up our differences equals up to no meal No mills yup no deal why you gotta chase shit To know its no thrills For real a nigga still beefin with his baby momma (BUT) Only thing my baby aint a baby no more Hit her on MySpace maybe she aint shady no more Sent old girl a message no reply but she read it Some things are so embedded and our heads is Looking for O's but get X's, dealing wit ya exes I was one long line away from the Tetris She sent me the L that sent me to hell To the point where I was ignoring my son I don't see him don't talk to him I don't greet him don't walk wit him But I pay for him like hes an object No matter how right I am in court I can't object Dear Diary how could she deny me How she go to bed without her fuckin wit her psyche Is she wrong using him so I can come back (or) Or am I wrong for wishing I could get my cum back Looking for sun all I see is the hail How I'm gon trust All I see is betrayal Its like they keep trying more and more to subdue me And only you understand

more I guess I... pack up all of my belongings and just troop it You know its beef when a smart nigga get stupid Then its justified, rational nullified He's been shot 8 times, almost thought my brother died See he was raised different, I know his mother tried His arms tied, I'm tryna teach dude to touch the sky But still shorty wild Turned on by 40 cals Was young never saw me wild, clutch Robert Horry style No wonder why I picked up triggers to beef I only ever fist fought with niggas bigger than me I never been the one to try to grab shit in my reach Incompliant, you have now witnessed the breach I feel like life is all written, understand my math Got on my knees told God I had a plan he laughed I mean..

Whos who? Paranoid as usual Gripping on my deuce deuce Either way a lose lose All I need is one mic Razor blades, gun fights Grew without no sun light Understand sons plight If done right, wont seek and fail I dont follow the path I'm creating my own to leave a trial No rhyme or reason Nor reason to rhyme No more food for thought Shit was seasoning mine Now they counting my desire Second guessing my fast life Bringing weapons of mass in when you question my passion I live for this Not the baguettes and the fame Got signed having the awnser then the question changed Saying jump off dont sound right Is blashphemous, down right I astound mics Music is just what feelings sound like So even though when I do it its flames For a while felt like I was making music in vein We dont view it the same I use it for change Y'all do it for change I use it for pain But keep doing your thing Soundscans sky rocket Build all this hype bout it People might cop it This is just my logic Maybe its psychotic Though labels try to stop it This is my antibiotic So let me start doing what dudes like A nigga in the booth feeling fresher then some new nikes And I cruise like cruise-control No fuck that!! I cant do it, I might lose my soul Even though shit help a nigga to his goal Would defeat the whole purpose Nahh that ain't what Jerz is Nahh that would be worthless Bars sounding nervous A nigga much deeper then what you see on the surface I rather resort back to snatching purses Finally understanding what the gift and the curse is If I was more concerned about a purchase I would tell yall its about to go down like bird shit It takes courage, me verses urges Words split and got caught up in label merges And whats worse is I've been deserted in the circus Up and left the circuit It's dead like herses Sicker then the pedaphiles working in the churches That ain't the type of shit I need fit for my verses So lemme help niggas understand mouse Why try to fit in when you a stand out? No album but the money never ran out Beside from rap I'm kinda focused on land now Cause I dont know where the game is It's just been attacked by Hurricane Chris So niggas cant fathom what money and fame is Well some niggas get it by using their stainless Well some niggas get it what the kid sustain in Me! ..

Look, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open Wouldn't get suits them shits was made to be broken 'Member comin up dudes talkin bout hoes, boastin I was just a Juvenile movin in Slow Motion I dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry Once I got it shit wasn't even cool to me I dreamt of condos and video vixens Until I learned most girls in videos is pidgeons I just wanted the world to see that I was for real wit it Wanted a deal, I got it and couldn't deal wit it I want me and my old homeboys to still kick it I wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket Let the beat play I wish I could see a day wit no he say, she say, just wanna see Trey Wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters Middle child, wish me and my brother was closer I wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to And then remember it takes two people to argue All she do is provoke me All I do is diss her All I did was shake her She say that I hit her She just takin everything I say out of context I'm tryin not to black, I'm like a nigga wit a complex Was mad as a FUCK, didn't even show it Yesterday was better off, didn't even know it Complete role reversal so it's usless these days TV got real, music went fake Please help her for God's sake When I proposed to the game I figured life was merry 5 years later I'm feelin like Tyler Perry Maybe I'm exhausted, maybe I just lost it Maybe I should pick up a pen and try 'n force it Same old story, guts and no glory They tryna low ball me, do him like Joe Torre I reintroduced myself to the world, I'M JERZ I'm a artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words More than a rapper I pay attention to detail But how I do in retail tells me if I prevail Leadin all the way see these trials and tribulations Foul situations with some mild stipulations I feel like being a addict cuz it hurts But somethin 'bout dude makes bad shit worse Look, its three types of niggas in this world ya know So you either gon' make shit happen OR Watch shit happen OR Not know what happened So i couldn't just sit there like 'FUCK rappin' Its dudes with problems I couldn't imagine havin If I had to have 'em I couldn't fathom me lastin, like I used to bump into Tammy in the club Few of them, she even helped a nigga get in See a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit em Care for em, be more than high and by wit em Its been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased She was my reality check, cuz we the same age I mean she put on a show that you CAN'T stage She made the shit sound effortless I was damn near in tears checkin my messages I got goosebumps all over my skin She said "Mouse I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again Hope everything is well kid You see I'm just findin out I have a brain tumor but I never felt it The doctor's givin me three weeks to live Not three weeks til I die, thats three weeks to give I just wanna tell you that I love you and I care I wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career"... And then she broke into tears I pressed 7, took the phone from my ears Sometimes the simplest of things people need it But I ain't call back in fear of being speechless What was I to put her at ease wit? I picked a real bad time to be stradegic I think my lifes bad, pickin up the pieces Some folk already got they appointment to see Jesus In this world full of diseases I've learned not to bite my tongue or have siezures Depression tells me I suck So I reply "I ain't here cuz I fell down, I'm here cuz I got up" And then I'm goin back and forth with Ransom Shit came outta nowhere, was real random According to him, I'm responsible for Jerz too "I never helped niggas?" How the FUCK you think they heard you? Muhfucka's got a lot of nerve duke I was the nigga believed in you spittin Had to con the industry just so they would listen But go 'head, you just gon' wreck yourself How was you protectin me, you can't protect yourself Keep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview And can't help but ask what's gotten into dude Media training but he don't know how that go It help you come across not soundin like an ASSHOLE In my past though been to jail, I ain't enjoy it So why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it? I ain't ig'nant, just because I exercise spiritually They try to ignore how I exercise lyrically I thought I had a great job Back when niggas loved the culture, wasn't in it for the money like a A-Rod Even when I'm spittin bout current events Its a sublime sayin 'Who's more current than him?' So I'm wonderin, if a higher power tryna underman When you shoot for the stars, sometimes you gonna jam I ain't been to Summer Jam I learned from Lupe: when you Dumb It Down its just harder to understand 2008, foes is still near me So you can think I'm tight as FUCK, I'm still weary The Geto Boys say its all in the mind Certain wounds only heal over time No shame in my game No pain no gain And since I ain't see a +prophet+ I figured God would stop it Waitin on a alley, niggas just won't lob it Still a risk taker lemme put it in words: Can't steal second base and keep your foot on first Been about 10 years since I was high off the angel Now I'm walkin side by side with an angel In front of my eyes that prize keep gettin dangled But can't grab at it, my pride is being strangled Workin shorty's nerves like a personal trainer But its me, its personal, it ain't her Friends keep tellin me "leave her," I won't Cuz she sees somethin in me that I DON'T And I see somethin in her that ya'll won't If u never been in love don't tell me I'm wrong See I preach gratitude, she keeps an attitude Argue long enough and that shit becomes laughable My norm now since my heart is so natural Wish I could dwell into all them niggas after you So not compatible, that we compatible Its nothin else in this worl that we would rather do Anybody out there relate to my pain? Turn the music up let me know that I'm sane We broke up, bitches was starin' at my chain Dude was fuckin you but starin' at my name But we ain't gotta entertain all that Back like we never left, we overcame all that FUCK who made better tacos or who ass fatter Its different now, right now, none of that matters Keep bringin it up its gon' backlash us Why am I meetin' so many backstabbers? Why whenever I'm bout to crash I go faster? Past is a disaster When your house is see through, learn to close your eyes incase the glass shatters Just sayin, its always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep thinkin I'm on the last chapter No tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that That and New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack Cuz I get older....(trails off) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Joe Budden f/ Mr. Probz Album: Mood Muzik 3: For Better or For Worse Song: I'm Serious (Long Way to Go) Typed by: PDog1217@aol.com [Intro - Joe Budden - talking] Ya mean?

I'm talkin' bout somethin called...somethin' I like to call "it" Ain't really got a name fro it Only certain niggas suffer from this shit Talkin' bout niggas that got like, niggas that got like a 6th sense Sometimes you see shit that ain't there Sometimes you hear shit ain't no body said nothin' Sometimes you think you somewhere and you really somewhere totally different It's almost like you hallucinating But you sober, you ain't high. No drugs and nothin' like that Sometimes you can BE high. Talkin' bout like, some paranoia or some shit Four walls, they surround me. Loneliness has found me I'm waiting for you to return. Open the door, walk right on in Darling let's start all over again [Joe Budden] Look. I don't give a fuck again Thoughts in my head, lookin' like a nigga stuck with them Wishing it abruptly ends. But God woke him up again Everything is seeming so unfair. So unclear Tryin' to reach out no one's there Four walls tell em go run where no one cares Screamin' this too shall pass ridin' on fumes without gas, bills pilin' up without cash Tryna maintain and outlast Pray for me, keep tellin' niggas patiently wait for me Keep tellin haters wait and see, I'm really tryna fill a vacancy Been a long time it's taking me. Muhhfuckas keep mistakin' me Mistakenly, cagin' me. Niggas never had no faith in me Just a few pennies from dead I got no identity left, victim of idenity theft Problems never knew, it's revenue. Keep blamin' em it's never you Keep tellin' baby girl I'm gonna leave and never do Cause even when a nigga needs space, When you lookin' for a little leeway Somebody puts it on replay, it's like it gets louder with each day Pray [Chourus] Four walls, they surround me. Loneliness has found me I'm waiting for you to return. Open the door, walk right on in Darling let's start all over again [Joe Budden] Look, look. I'm tryna keep it formal now. But the pressure's on him now I'll go ahead and warn you now, I'm tryna come across as normal now All my life, I've been called insane. Looked at as if I'm strange Can't tame em. Can't blame em for lookin' at me as if I can't change With that said still I'm a rise. Though I keep it still in lies Go ahead reveal your disguise, maybe that'll kill the surprise Sometimes I feel deprived. Startin' when the guilt arrives I noticed that the hills have eyes. When you on a heels of demise And your man's on a ledge. Niggas tamperin' with my head Hangin' head in the Phantom. Phantom's in my head Can't escape, figured I'd be a candidate I ain't gotta upper-hand to date. Can't be fate Must think that I can handle weight. See, I'm thinkin of mansions, lakes I was thinkin' Mandalay. Thinkin' I'd expand my stay That's just the chance I'll take Bow to my knees so the crowd appease, put em in the mouth of the beast Crazy they didn't make him out to be I'm just tryin' to make it out at least. Please [Refrain] [Outro over Chorus] See what I'm talkin bout, they ain't really got terms for shit I'm talkin 'bout I know they just diagnosed me with this shit. Like a, like a early age or shit I don't mean four walls literally, nothin' like that Four walls, I'm talkin' bout.. Ain't no windows. Ain't no sunlight. Ain't even a door No locks, no nothing. Ain't gettin' outta that shit You just try and get stuck I'm talkin' bout four walls in ya head baby I know a nigga like me I been talkin' about a niggle like me for a long time Fucked up out here Can't even escape We gon get em (haha) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Joe Budden Album: Mood Muzik 3: For Better or For Worse Song: 5th Gear Typed by: PDog1217@aol.com [Intro - Joe Budden - talking] Mic check, mic check Mic check, mic check Ah, yeah Y'all know who it is, taha Oh!

(going, going, gone) L-look, look, look See I don't trust no one (talk to 'em) So stubborn I could dream a thousand paths, wake up and walk a old one (Why?)

But niggaz fuck with him cause I be the exception (look) I got a warm reception way before any song hit I think too outside of the box to be cornered I'm too real to be fickle Grounded but too fly to meet a nigga in the middle Too big to be belittled Wise way beyond my years, here's the motto of a man-child (what?) Why try to fit in when you a standout? Ohh [Joe Budden] Uhh, you in that mood yet? Why not?

I won't succumb to all those stereotypes Won't sacrifice me for what the stereo hypes They told me get in where you fit in, this is what's in demand now So I - told 'em why try to fit in when you a standout? Ohh [Joe Budden] Knahmean? Yo  I understand somethin's off 'bout me (but) but nothin's forced 'bout me I never gave a fuck of what a nigga thought 'bout me (ohh) I look down upon what some see as a must Maybe I'm regular and the world needs to adjust I mean I'm everyday people (ohh) hood but still formal I'm normally abnormal - takin life as a lesson I'll leave the past in the past, tomorrow is not promised And today's just a gift  I guess that's why it's the present Did I outgrow me, or shit just didn't stick? The baggier my jeans, the more shit didn't fit (but I!) Didn't quit, inspired by hate, even with homeless When you a +Star+ you already down with the Joneses My thoughts out loud (I mean) Sometimes if the leader walks slow enough  he fuck around get lost in the crowd (but) But he ain't gotta speed up, e'rything'll pan out (why?)

do both Then she apologize for anything that she did  Said with out me she can't think of no reason to live  Said she'll miss getting piped down  The she picked up a shank I to tell the crazy bitch to put the knife down Crying  Eye shadow on her face Filthy  Feel me if you kill you  It's gonna kill me  Really  She said you neglect me  I said we the same  So whatever you do it's gone affect me  You know I can't let it be  So if we have to stay together just to co-exist then so it is  She said I loved you then hugged me  Took her pants off and proceeded to fuck me  She be calling my name

tomorrow was my birthday I would never know  Understand I'm kinda bad with dates  I don't need a party but a nigga need cake  Cause I got to much on my plate to celebrate  Whole family unemployed  So incomes now a void Footin everybody's bills  So naturally I'm annoyed  It's like the year kinda flew by  And like a fool I sat back and scrutinized  I'm high beaming on a dark road  All my goals now ashes on charcoal I spark stogs  Disregard car's  Just cause my hearts cold I'm carrying cargo No offense  Don't need a phone call or a presents  I mean honestly I don't want none of ya'll present

they ain't tell me tomorrow was Halloween I'd never known I've never been the type to keep up with dates so while ah  Everybody is putting there mask on  Nigga I rock mine all year  Just to avoid stares To come across like a nigga who cares  So to my peers I can look like I'm really sincere Yeah  Everything's not what it appear I fear being rare my costume aware  I swear I won't take it off like near It's weird  Even when I take it off shits near To some my outfit is sheer So I despise their jeers cause they know I see them all as mirror Don't love ya'll enough to let you see me bare  Let you see how he's impaired  Naw I'm not there We tend to run from anything weird  At least on holloween ya'll would stay right there  Yeah  Everydays the same to me  Seven days in every week Some

[Verse three] If I didn't read it was Christmas I'd never known  Maybe I'm wrong I don't give a fuck about dates  So while everybody's unwrapping gifts  I'm trying to capitalize of mine  Just to get some shine  Outta recline while I'm still in my prime  To many time when the date came I ain't have a dime  So I look at my friends with envy   For some reason them getting gifts would offend me  Like there home was perfect  Mine felt empty  They say that it's the thought that counts  I had plenty  Like why  On thanksgiving my family would never visit  And even when they did it always seemed so scripted  Like they was forced to  Like small talk would resolve the 364 days they ain't call you  I should act like ya'll somebody I'm close to  Holidays don't make me socials  I have to be vocal  Everydays the same to me  Seven days in every week Some look forward to it  But I don't change as for the holiday's You can have your Christmas tree  Go get drunk on New Years eve  Some look forward

cared it was against me Tell god to be there in case I fall Tell the fans I never jipped them I always gave them my all Tell my girl She put me threw it But if I had to go threw it with anybody I'm thankful it's her Tell every member of my family For to long I hid behind my own insanity it got me caught up And somebody tell currency I chased him to the death I thought I'd catch the nigga till I ran outa breath Tell my bruises I'm fine I'm good I normally heal quick Tell the rain come down I need to feel it I told the nigga give me a hand but he wouldn't I kept telling myself I can't Until I couldn't If niggas want to kill me tell em I already died Tell anybody that will listen i tried Till the water ran dry tell the water get the fuck out my eyes Tell the crust it taste great but I'd much rather the pie Ask success what I have to do to succeed Then tell my twin brothers I look at them like my seeds Ya'll with be the mouths I feed If a nigga ever tell me how to get rid myself of some of this greed I tell em that I'm grown really I ain't finish growing Look tell failure I ain't want to get to know em Tell the stick up kids to come and get me Tell the stereotypes I tried them shits on they didn't fit me Tell who ever I wronged I apologize They tell me though there bumps in the road But still I gotta ride they tell me I got a lotta pride I tell them how the fuck you gone tell me what I got inside Then they wanna lecture a nigga tell me life is what you make it That's when I tell them I beg to differ The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page

I can see my every breath like a cold day Stood before a man with no face  he said to me... ::voice:: ::Please don't make this any harder...:: WHO THE FUCK IS YOU? ::My child I'm your father...:: I only got one dad! ::Is that a fact to you? He left you when you was young I brought him back to you Your real close to heaven, few get to step in now tell me what you've done to deserve to be let in?:: Look I'm far from a christian Not big on religion But aint done too much wrong my entire time living Never killed never tried too tho I been lied to Was once suicidal never read the bible I always been a care taker tried to nurse people At times it back fired hurt people hurt people Plus I never use your name in vain But you should know everything I'm being asked to explain ::I know you stole from your mothers purse:: You can't count that, that was way back when! ::Its still a sin:: But I was ten! ::You robbed people, stole:: Yeah and YOU made me see jail! ::but I also seen you lay your hands on a female sold drugs to parents none of that was needed abandenned your child, on every girl you cheated Done wrong to people that only want the best for you Any time you thought you were alone I was next to you:: When it came to baby moms GOD you gave me the worse one! ::but that was your second child Joe you shouldn't killed the first one:: I aint have a job aint have a pot to piss in ::Look I gave you a gift and you made the wrong decision Held onto resentments even in doing business I lead by example, I teach forgiveness your entry can not be Gur-an-teed not when you live with anger, envy, greed pride, sloth, lust even gluttony everything you shouldn't if you woulda joined my company:: Look I'm only human I aint perfect. ::That I understand. When I take you out a jam you don't even think to worship, and when you do... you never talk about what you can do for me its what I can do for you? I blessed you with health, family and wealth with all the blessings you received you still always want help:: Yeah theres been times in my life I needed help to make money  But why everything I love you manage to take from me? Yet you stand there an question a nigga that tries hard and finds a way when you keep dealing them FUCKED up cards! You make mistakes like ME far as I can see I think its a mockery whenever rich niggas win the lottery Gave us Busch twice God I hate to be rude  But you let skinny niggas starve give obese niggas food THE NERVE of you telling me I don't deserve to stay here When you gave us drugs and GUNS you put AIDS here! Take a look at you, your actions are cold hearted The harsh shit is you bring babies in the world retarded I know most my actions put me in a cell But how you mad at me when you put me in the hell ::See my child you need gratitude, maybe just a sample I never give a person anything they cant handle Don't tell me about everything you had to go through there's reasons for my actions even if I never showed you Kept trying with you all you did was hurt me still gave you chances to prove that you was worthy and so I sat with you on a train I asked you for change you kept calling me names. Prolly didnt notice I was the store clerk, you put the gun to me get money for more work my child I know you have it in you to indeed stop this is not your final calling just a brief stop Hope you heed my words and understand so when I see you back you should be a better man look at life different the next time we see each other there be no need for talk whenever we meet each other:: The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Joe Budden Album: Padded Room Song: Who Pt. 1 * Typed by: PDog1217@aol.com * Amalgam Digital download bonus track [Intro - Joe Budden - talking] (*echo*) I mean a (yeah) I'm doin all these interviews (cheah) Everybody (Jump Off!) want to know what I think of the state of hip hop  (uh) Whether I think it's dead or not (uh) Question ain't whether it's dead (uh) It's more like (it's) It's more like who killed it? (it's, it's what?) (It's that On Top Music!) Now look, look, look [Verse 1 - Joe Budden] Can anybody pinpoint the day it went wrong? I mean I used to blame reggaetón I can't front, I thought all that was corny (I can't front, I thought all that was corny) Was it Ja's fault? Lil' Mo said she ain't get paid for +Put It On Me+ (She ain't get paid for +Put It On Me+) Look, bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit (or) Was it T-Pain with that funny voice shit? (or) or was it Lil Wayne with that funny voice shit? The whole game did growed that funny voice shit (The whole game did growed that funny voice shit) I can't tell when it happened Was it when Lil Jon showed dudes you could sell without rapping? Was it +Laffy Taffy+? I thought they was kiddin Shawty Lo said +Dey Know+ (Dey Know), I really didn't (naw) Dancin became cool again, then came +Walk It Out+ But I ain't know what the fuck niggaz was talkin about (But I ain't know what the fuck niggaz was talkin about) Unit kicked Game out, they ain't give a fuck Then we seen the same shit happen to Buck (Buck) It was a few years ago but I remember the summer (what happened?) 50 made fans start lookin at the numbers (oh) A&R's won't take risks, they won't sign niggaz The word 'swag' come out, started to blind niggaz (started to blind niggaz) Rap dudes want reality shows And my dumb ass is thinkin that reality's soul Did it start with the iPod Or when rappers had to pay DJs for them to do they job? (do they job) I mean all the content is the same, it won't differ (it won't differ) Everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers (or pulled triggers) More you think about it, you gon' just get sicker And why the fuck would Nas want to call his shit "Nigger?" (Nigger!) Was it when the Wu broke up? Pac, Big Pun, went to sleep, never woke up Lupe was doin a tribute and choked up And some of these stupid ass fans like - "so what?" (like so what?) Some of them they ain't educated And fuck blamin the south, we ain't segregated I mean (nigga), was all good around the 'Kiss and Beans shit Take a left turn around the 'Kiss and Green shit (around the 'Kiss and Green shit) Maybe it all started, when Roc-A-Fella parted Wait, (is it?) is it natural to shift toward fame? (is it?) I watched every last one of dudes shit on Dame Kind of got that in common, I could dig that pain When they gave Jay a desk and suit They finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute But something told me the suits at the tables was hurtin They fired everybody, labels started mergin (They fired everybody, labels started mergin) As far as sales, the decline is strong Ask the experts, they'll say that the climate's wrong (They'll say that the climate's wrong, I mean) I mean, some niggaz' primes is gone I peeped it when niggaz started puttin fake diamonds on (oh) You could tell a dude, "I spit better than you" But then, he'll say I'm richer for whatever I do (come on) I seen all this comin, I knew what we was in for Back when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window (oh) Was it when Mase retired and couldn't hack it? T.I.P. could, he just needed some more ratchets (just needed some more ratchets) DJs, producers, one's that get us the farthest Said "fuck rappers!" and they became the artists I got to talk candid Did we start havin issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did? (oh) Was it when Chingy thought he ain't need Ludacris? His next album found out that that was ludicrous (ludicrous!) Papoose and Clipse both survived Inkin with Jive, then gettin jived Your man J-Hood repped that D-Block gang Then I seen dude draggin his D-Block chain Or did one hit wonders change it all along? They made labels only want to sign a dude's song And you really don't know shit If you think the fans pick the videos on "106" (nigga) D I'm just statin the truth Did it start when Fox stayed in the news more than she did the booth? (oh) Or was it when Lil' Kim stopped exploitin sex? The fuck is up with DMX? I hope dude straight (dude straight) Have an opinion and they gon' say you hate (you hate) I can't front, I'm missin the old Clue tapes (oh) The underground sunk further The Feds was on Irv, so the Inc. dropped Murder I never blamed Fab, Jeezy, Rick Ross (naw) Did shit get lost when Shyne went up north? (naw) I never understand the hip hop police When hip hop is what hip hop needs to police! (hip hop needs to police nigga!) These blatant ass radio attempts sound so bland (oh!) Twista kept tryin to recreate +Slow Jamz+ (nigga!) Did we send the wrong message with our slang? There's broke niggaz blowin their rent to "make it rain" So you walk in, give a bitch a few twenties And she'll smirk her face up, lookin at you funny (you funny) This chick told me she only take new money Man I snatched my shit back so fast (man I snatched my shit back so fast) Or did it start when rappers said "fuck it!" Sacrificed music, started rapin their budget (whoa) Nothin wrong with dudes being candy or pop Somethin was wrong when Joc did the +Candy Shop+ (fuck is wrong with him?) We buyin our own records, maybe no one's to blame Are we a business that we can't afford to maintain? The second week show that boy's numbers ain't high I hate to break it to you, numbers always lie Or when Ortiz signed to Aftermath And now he's feelin the aftermath (my nigga) Was it Fight Club fuckin with them battle raps? But not too many of 'em gettin signed after that (signed after that) I mean, some can't stay afloat A million Busta albums, he still not mention with the G.O.A.T. (nope) Fuck lookin for answers, time'll tell Was it when Def Jam didn't want to resign L? A fifteen year old told me Cass was ass But rather than spaz, all dude could do was laugh (whoa) Or was it when the whole east coast fell off Or got comfortable, maybe dudes was to well off (maybe dudes was to well off) The more niggaz said that they ain't write down lyrics The more it started to sound like they didn't But do whatever you can to keep the lights on But dumbin down just became the new Dylan Honestly I ain't know what to think A few years ago, we had the young kids wearin pink I can't blame the fans for not knowin a damn thing When we trained 'em to be this way I mean showed 'em whatever to sell with no limits Since the early '90's sold 'em a false image So when some shit come that don't fit the mold It's like a mole (it's like a mole), nigga you won't even do gold (nigga) They watch the videos See you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you hood (and think that you hood) They turn on the TV, see these video bitches And they think niggaz' girls really look that good (really look that good) I mean they give so many free verses When the album drops, shit's more like a bonus (more like a bonus) Why pay for it, why take onus? With one click of a mouse, they could own it (oh) I mean some of them are fooled so easily By whatever we say or we show 'em on TV (we say or we show 'em on TV) But that was all part of the plan Or was it when Eminem made +Stan+ I swear some of these fans (I swear some of these fans) They put they whole life on the line It's like they can't like more than one rapper at a time Less about the product, more about the digits, it's a business (*fades out*) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Joe Budden Album: Padded Room Bonus Track Song: Who? Part 2 Typed by: jaysscholar@gmail.com It's a business; we got less fans and more critics Maybe we at a cross Canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost And I ain't believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me That KRS-One had a rap beef with Nelly If rap was alive, we'd be trying to be the best rappers ever Not the best rapper alive But you won't get accepted at all if you ain't street tough Onyx was the hardest 'til Sticky got beat up Now I'm A Thug' is how I got to behave If I want to be paid, if I want to see praise You know something's wrong when niggas are getting shot And you got to sit and wonder if the whole thing's staged It ain't real no more Or did we just expand on our audience, maybe we appeal to more Or, do we just think ya'll are just getting dumber? We tried to make getting older getting younger Did we lose our hunger? Something's got to give Did we outgrow ourselves? Is hip-hop for kids? If it is, they turn on MTV Cribs And think, "That's where these motherfuckers really live!" Or, was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic? So did the Fugees, till Wyclef tapped it Songs don't do it no more, the shit's shocking Seen it when "Lean Back" had the whole world rocking Now it's "Fuck your bars!" if your hook is fly So we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye Dope ass rappers ain't seeing no dough If everything's commercial, where the fuck is the show? But anybody making a dime, see, I'm a wish well Still we took a big L losing Big L Or was it when YouTube came in the game? Now nobodys from their living room can make a name Or when Indies like Koch came and blew up Niggas at the majors, they literally threw up To some, it ain't fun no more You know it's fucked up when DMC don't talk to Run no more Too many egos, like we ain't one no more Shit's predictable, niggas ain't stunned no more We starting to see shit we never seen before At one point, we even had the magazines at war Or, was it street DVD's like Smack Showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act? This shit get lifeless When MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest Changed the whole steelo I mean the averaged fan never heard of Goodie Mob or a Cee Lo But they heard of Gnarls Barkley And Dr. Carter still say we got a heartbeat I ain't going to lie, I was scared to death, straight up I started to hear rumors of an OutKast breakup I was like, "That ain't true, it sounds desperate" Then started to see Big Boi and 3K separate Had periods where it was drier than a desert Are we all killing this shit? Is it a group effort? Are we alive and well or barely surviving? Is it R&B's fault? Them niggas is thriving Then a lot of people go and blame LimeWire I don't think it's downloading dog, the line's tired Did the fans just get tired of the outcome? One dope single and a bullshit album So they share albums with each other Was it Master P with them ugly ass album covers? Or when we started appearing in the news? Timberland said they didn't want black niggas wearing they boots I mean, I know it got foggy, at least blurry When the label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray Or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names? Had the kids trying to buy shit they can't name And some think the evidence is ample Did it start when Puff took advantage of the sample? Is it all watered down with no fire? If you had enough money you can buy a ghostwriter Or the Diamond District, Jacob the Jeweler Had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler Fucking with them trends Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain't even in Look, is the game now as bad as it's ever been? It's not ringtones, just the songs that they represent I heard all of them The sad part I wouldn't recognize most these niggas if I saw them I can't explain it, I don't know what to tell you Now going Gold is look at as a failure Maybe old heads in charge just weren't able DJ's is spinning now with no turntable Maybe the fans are just bored of us Or maybe there ain't enough room for all of us It's like even a friendship will stop at a point Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug's joint But there's so many ways to get fucking rich Supahead caked off by just sucking dick Did we sell out just to get in demand more? Did we go against everything we used to stand for? Both are likely There's two sides to a coin, who you rolling with: Souljah Boy or Ice-T? Some niggas want to sit around and complain about I rather analyze, seek how it came about If we could rewind the world We wouldn't have to watch Flava Flav try to find his girl Look, today it's all about marketing and promo I remember VH1 was just for old folks But no ma'am If I ain't know better, I would think that mix show is now programmed We let the power of the dollar annihilate us Now the size of our chain going to validate us It's too simple; they can't think we're really deep I just heard Chris Brown on the A Millie beat Seen a video, it's called looking ass niggas Grabbed the remote, tired of looking at niggas But that let a nigga know if we ain't dead Then we just half alive, maybe brain dead Did it start when Capone left Nore? Nah, he went to jail, that's a whole different story Or, maybe something's really wrong with our ears Obie Trice got dropped, so much for +Cheers+ Female emcees, they don't ever hit the target Somebody said they saw Amil working in a Target The sad part is we already lost Remy Or did we go wrong when E-v-e got skinny? What's up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga? That I can't figure And Trina ain't been the same since +Nan Nigga+ I know it had to do something to his heart beat When Lady of Rage started doing Steve Harvey I know we caught a little trauma Somewhere between Yo Yo, Boss, and Lil Mama Lot of females found another way to extort Most of our video models have turned escort Do anything to see dough So they'll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role Or should we get back to basics? Where's the Rakims or the Master Aces? The Big Daddy Kanes, or did we never recover From Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover Or when rap dude started signing their friends Instead of going out and trying to find niggas with skill? Seen it happen when D-12 put out +Purple Pills+ And while the whole hood laughed, them niggas sold a mil Some of us ain't prepared for something so lucrative I just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit Like we almost caught one in the torso When each Bone Thugs member took they own crossroads Some disagree, some got to see the same Or maybe Hip-Hop died on Aailyah's plane If it relocated where did it move to? I still Love H.E.R. the way Common used to Or did Bill O' Reilly come fuck up the spirit With negative remarks about everybody's lyrics? Spend all this time dissing us Nigga you 95-years old, motherfucker shouldn't be a listener Lost Jam Master, who was +Tougher Than Leather+ Or did it start when Treach started fucking Pepa? As our jeans got tighter and our tee's got longer I'm trying to figure which age group do we belong to Or did we all go astray the second Dr. Dre left N.W.A.? I mean in my opinion we was on easy street When he was beefing with Eazy-E Or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat? Signing unknown niggas to start making their beats If you sell your own shit it got to go for cheap Put my name on it so the price increase Or, is it cause everybody's so self-centered? Is that the reason Hip Hop itself ain't centered? Or have we already seen this shit with our own eyes? Rico Suave, Hammer, and Vanilla Ice Everybody want in the game so in return You got label executives fucking their interns And anybody looking at that new Vibe bracket Should see that they don't know a thing about this rap shit Or maybe we should of stopped being proud When there was no more Rawkus and no more Loud Tried to get conscious around Vote or Die So they made it look like all our votes was lies As the years go on it's like we keep getting more voids We got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys I knew we was impersonating a fraud When Kay-Slay smacked my man at the awards Regardless, it's our fault as artists Running with entourages who act like they ain't never left the projects Who do we want to target Will they put an Uncle Murda CD in a Wal-Mart or a Target We got the nerve to not want to hear Ras Kass But fuck with V.I.C. "Get Silly" and that trash I felt ashamed When J-Kwon told me he ain't like Raekwon cause he stole his name Was back when everybody in the club got +Tipsy+ Now every contract got to be 360 So fuck eating better scrape the plate Now every beat got to at least have an 808 Did the lights get dim when we first heard Mims And said "Another New York rapper on the South tip"? Is it overcrowded? They keep saying, "If it's so fucked up, then do something about it" I doubt it, there's just one thing they don't understand That job is way bigger then just one man Or maybe all of these pleas that it's deceased Is false and it's right where it needs to be? Maybe we built on something that'll last forever See Face and Geto Boys just got back together Maybe no one can stop us, even other genre's now jock us We even doing songs with the rockers How is that the feeling? Kanye's +Amazing+, Wayne just sold a Million We closer to a ceiling How are we in a coma When we the only business you can excel without a diploma? Technology changed, made everything simple MySpace is now a dude's bio slash demo Aside from this rap we generating more money We took it global and penetrated other countries So let's celebrate, sip some Cris Some more shit we embrace just to end up dissed Go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent Let's go and cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent Or here's another bright idea to entertain Let's go and put our face on the bottom of a chain Are some of us just nigga rich, with nigga money? While jews keep laughin, "Look at these nigga dummies" Should Hip Hop be a stepping stool Till we find another role we can step into? Some of us doing movies as a matter of fact And some never stopped to plan life after rap I mean, as a whole did we stop moving further Around the time Snoop Dogg went on trial for murder? Or was it Scarface creating these clonies? 30 years later everybody's still Tony Maybe anybody complaining is deranged Can you expect something to grow and not change? We're socially accepted, deviated our old route To simplify the term we all sold out I think I figured out who's to blame Started out Obama, ended up McCain So we Kurt Cobained ourself and we're defeated So next time they ask "who killed it?" tell them "we did" The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Slaughterhouse Album: Slaughterhouse Song: Sound Off Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com  [Royce Da 5'9"] You herbs we merged, we're an alliance We fight fire with flame-throwers, why would you try us?

(talk to 'em) How could the critics ever hear me and say I'm a suffer? How when they play with words and I make 'em play with each other? Choppers over the booth, ready for prime time Become one with his thoughts, intertwine with his mind Go toe to toe, blow for blow or do it rhyme for rhyme Be competitive coke heads and go line for line Honestly that crap of yours, you should raffle off With me they gettin Genius Bars without the Apple store Under the microscope, I rebut' the scrutiny If I'm to be compared, it's only to who I used to be Take a closer look at rappers and you might discover This faggot's talkin boxing, avoid the Mike Buffers Now you the type to cuff her, me I get tired of her See you the type get hyped to hug her but won't try to fuck her Them pencil thin bitches, me that ain't the style he dates Mine sit on the bed and leave an imprint of a smiley face To introduce the newcomers to my habitat The calm's before the storm, this the debris from the aftermath  (aftermath) [Break - Sample from "Rocky Balboa"] Let me tell you something you already know The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it You, me or nobody, is gonna hit as hard as life But it ain't about how hard ya hit It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward [Verse 2 - Joe Budden] Check it, check, check it, let me change pace The alternate route's a long one but you'll ultimately end up in the same place So I tell aspiring artists "think beyond greater" I know some niggaz with platinum plaques and bronze paper But better livin should be earned, never fed or givin So I traded my recognition instead for a vision They always told me that I'd end up dead or in prison Who ever thought that same dude gettin head while he whippin That the chicks would hang up on? Give 'em the dial tone Now buyin wild homes, straight cash without loans I always managed to do better when there's doubt shown I'll teach you how to turn them diamonds into milestones Class is in session and look who's come to tutor They passin the fake off as real like Brian Pumper's jeweler Where I'm from niggaz with fear gettin slumped by shooters But my equal to dumpin Rugers is done by computers I'm gettin bread, every verse like the lotto Give 'em substance but they treat every word like it's a hollow (blaat) My niggaz off parole, I'm tryin to give 'em somethin pure to follow 'Cause he ain't have a pot to piss in, just a urine bottle I come from where so many people were raised with neglect Cops tryin to meet they quota, thirsty to make an arrest All my wrongdoings did, was put my faith to a test Which made me much stronger, guess my mistakes were correct (oh!) Ta ha Ta ha (ta ha)! [Outro - Sample from "Rocky Balboa"] Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth But ya gotta be willing to take the hit Not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of  him, or her, or anybody!

Forced to find inspiration when I never had to So I go against myself, it's a better battle Now come along, c-come, come along Turned up the volume on her favorite song (favorite song) We got so much in common (except) Except when it comes to rhymin She feel like lyrics are so intrusive But I feel about her, the way she feels about music She's cute She don't like the words, she just like the beat and I'm thinkin me too (biatch!)

I'm sorry I don't speak the language of Rappers that's in the closet but they won't hang it up I'm only tryin to build what they attempt to destroy We had a perfect game until it was Jim Joyce'd Check it, what was once so majestic, is now only adored by epileptics I record to resurrect it, by my own accord I can't accept it But when somethin gives you nightmares, can you afford to recollect it? If you can just know them odds stacked "Airplanes ain't shootin stars", you can't B.o.B that I found out when it come to discussin paper Some'll sell they soul and deal with the repercussions later [Chorus - Joe Budden] With every curve they throw, every shot that blows, I'm still here It be the ones that's pretendin to know, really have no idea I just let 'em all go ahead and speak my name How far you gonna reach for fame?

Women have a tendency to get fickle Predictable, lie and say his dick little It be the ones you could see yourself with forever Givin you a lecture, talkin about you neglect her Couple years in, the strip club will upset her And she'll act like you ain't have them same habits when you met her When you can't take her You start droppin hints for her to read between the lines but she'll act like Fantasia It'll be so much to be said but no one'll convey it The relationship will be over but no one'll say it A doomed fate, livin with who you'd soon hate Ex-life partners trying to co-exist as roommates Once you go through it, you'll believe it And you'll never give a woman more than you'll want her to leave with (oh!) [Verse 3 - Joe Budden] Check it, how can the fans think us rappers are invincible? Can't find anything about that logic that's sensible I'm thinkin they should know better off of principle To them we're action heroes, to labels we're "Expendables" (talk to 'em) My old approach was apprehensible Some started thinkin they fifteen minutes of fame was extendable (nah) They don't cherish the moment like they probably should Once they star's cemented, they act Hollywood Gwapped up stacks to grip Now you're being chauffeured in the back of whips, lifestyle's immaculate Out of touch with reality, I'll help you get a grasp of it Success breeds change but so does a lack of it The homies sendin out subliminals Since you a failed rapper, failed criminal, four bars the minimal Since you ain't from the streets, I'll help and tell you the way it works Say a nigga snitchin, I'm sayin "show me the paper work" I don't get why the inferior bother to diss me Heart of my city, when I go, takin part of it with me I think God'll understand that was part of my misery So instead of "Father forgive me," it's "Father, ya dig me?" Spectated just to see if I'd be checkmated Less progress brings less hatred, which would segue it I learned the hard way some things are better kept sacred Fail at given 'em your all, you'll just be left naked [Chorus] - w/ ad libs [Outro - Joe Budden - talking] (*echo*) One more 'gain, oh!

Waitin for our shot to shoot to the moon Were we just dreamerz? Spendin our lives tryin to see this thing through Waitin to fly away We're waitin to fly away Waitin to fly away waitin to fly away, right away and flyin by you [Verse 2 - Joe Budden] How we go from thoughts of marriage? Thoughts of me coppin karats Talks of what we'd name her, while shoppin for a carriage But when the dream stopped, who knew you'd see me like a savage? That you dreamt of vacations, but only woke up to baggage All you ever did was love me and look at where it got you (uh) And when you wanted more, all I did was say "I'm not you" I'm selfish not selfless and I say that with love So in essence you askin for what I'm incapable of So now I find I'm goin over choices I ain't even made yet (made yet) Was clouded by good times and great sex (great sex) Runnin fast towards an unknown fate That altered when I introduced you to my unknown traits In your dreams, seems you had me pegged as another man But in mine, only you would understand In our minds we were perfect, we witnessed our dream get murdered Now reality's on trial and we both awaitin the verdict [Break - Joe Budden] - w/ Emanny ad libs But you'll always be close to me Though you said this ain't how it's supposed to be What we had was so real But you said I don't care Never thought this day would come You said you gave your all and was left with none But we can both be spared But you don't think that's fair, that's fair [Chorus] - w/ ad libs [Verse 3 - Joe Budden] Uh, you can't see how you ever began to like a liar You lost track of all the little things that I admired But when the peace left, I knew we might retire Thinking man, I live upstairs, I'm something like Somaya Got memories but at what point are they lost? You say we could work through it, at what point is it forced? We should of never rushed 'Cause it's like now we at a point where you won't ever trust And for me I can't believe that's all we ever was The high is gone, need a better buzz (better buzz) 'Cause we sleep in the same bed but we never touch (never touch) My solution to every beef is to revisit Though we'll have the same emotions, we won't be so livid, won't be so vivid I think your girl secretly applauded our drama, we don't need those critics (uh) We owe it to go over our foundation with a keen eye Sad part to say you never have the same dream twice [Break 2 - Emanny] we let love and all it's possibility, take us from reality Made it hard to see that (we were bound together) Just to cover up the pain, I'm wishin the skies would rain And wipe all my thoughts away, 'cause I'm tired of dreamin [Chorus] - w/ ad libs The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Slaughterhouse Album: Move On 12" Song: Move On Typed by: jaysscholar@gmail.com [Verse 1: Joell Ortiz] No I don't respond with answers that fit a script  So the repetition will make a nigga flip  We in the game of smoke and mirrors  Those engineering a bigger spliff  Blowing circles out they mouth getting praise but the shit is shift  I never lived a myth, if I said it I did it  Never alleged, word to dead I gripped a fifth  I made my housing tenement a strip, moving medicine and nicks  When I seen them coming I jetted from them pricks  And still to this day, though she clean, I wish my mommy never sniffed  But the hurt is making me better with this gift  I'm live with this ink, you could die in a blink and Y'all got the nerve to ask me why do I drink and Motherfuckers, sometimes I cry when I'm thinking  Y'all ain't there when them tears being dried by the sink  It was cold in the winter, my community centers who gave me dinner  I ain't mind, my table chairs gave me splinters  Set up to be a loser but was made to be a winner  If they paint Hip-Hop I bet my face be in the picture  If they wrote a rap bible, bet my name be in the scriptures  If shorty say I'm her idol, bet her face be in my zipper  I came a long way from the staples in my skrilla  Stains on my pants hardly had a cut  The ladies ain't want to dance so house parties would suck  All my friends on the wall, I'm in the hall with a cup  Nah I ain't complaining, just telling y'all what it is  So if y'all going through it now just know that another kid  Made something out of nothing - well I'm fronting, I was never nothing  Older ladies used to tell my mother "Ain't he something?" I look at a lot of you cats and laugh  Cuz I'm the shit, man, and y'all ain't even passing gas  When I spit, I'm the definition of mastered craft  And all y'all ask about is Aftermath  Motherfucker move on [Verse 2: Joe Budden] I got to give my own interview  Since niggas that do my interviews focus on whatever's miniscule  And paint me as a cynical  But the canvas will limit you, you can't go beyond what there's no limit to  If I think Hip-Hop is dead I think it's being revived  And that comes from me being inside  Where the demons get by, see them goodbye  If I'm vehement here's why  Come from hearing it and seeing venomous lies  So the beast in me cries cuz when it's all you hear  Shit can overbear just when the over in air  So I try to think straight cuz when you stare in the rear  Rest in peace Stewart Shakir, nigga yea  I'm on another label, not that other label  That mean it's no longer my problem, it's theirs  Some say it's a conspire I say if everybody's on the thrown that's just more motive to kill the heir  Ask me about Pump It Up' and I'm a think you sheep  Oh you must not know I'm deep  I'm so off of music so y'all can soundscan every week  Me? I just got my little man every week  Jersey City loves me despite y'all beliefs  Cuz they was baby stepping, I showed them how to leap  Ask me about swag,  I'm a change the topic to lyrics and then brag  Plus look at you like a fag  I love everybody, don't ask about who I beef with  They burnt the bridge but they was standing underneath it  I'm on my grind, Benjamin hunting  Was old since I was young, call me Benjamin Button  Stop using slang just for you to be cool  Cuz I go back to when it was cool to be you  I'm a hero, no I mean I'm Hiro from Heroes  Y'all chase zeros  Motherfucker I just got finished hating me, feeling like a zero  They played De Niro, never been there though  So before your next thought, understand  Know it's much more to me than a man  Either that or move on [Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"] My rhymes a reflection of Scarface and Prem's soul  Before Jordan was wearing four five  I just look like this, I just seemed old  But I had to bleed the blood of a dirty motherfucker  To suffer clean clothes and touch what a king holds  The real estate market is harsh, everything goes  From folds to who you was doing everything for  But I cut them off and move on to the new checks  New friends chasing my new ends with new threats  Watching my dreams fold like a stack of bills  In the pocket of who ain't trying to push up daffodils  But we the super group, you couldn't handle this shit  If you were standing before us carrying the pooper scoop  You dealt with shady shit? I dealt with shady shit  But I'm the only one can truly say I dealt with Shady's shit  I mean that with all respect to Paul and Sheck  But Ryan and Marshal is all you get  My flows superb, I love Pauli Rosenberg 	 What I say in a track those just words  Baby boy forgive me, I'm just street  Cuz I can change into anything niggas want me to be like Mystique I don't got to dig deep to realize  Slim bought Big Proof a big jeep  Because he deserved it, how can I mourn  The same way Shady did over him when he knew him when he attended Osborne? Marshal I'm sorry, I knew it went left  I ain't into fucking my family like incest  If you remember ice used to be my life's interest  Tell Hailey my wife just had a princess  Since I made up with Em there's nothing else  That I can move on from so who wants some  Like a jar of Grey Poupon  You have to ask anybody in any car  Want it? Or move on [Verse 4: Crooked I] When fans picture my interviews they think I'm in a swimming pool  With women who've been abused  So they turn into strippers making they living in the nude  One in the middle blowing my inner tube while the interviewers getting ridiculed  Is this your vision? Cool. Let me give you a little jewel  Any dude who want to sit in my tennis shoes is missing screws  Don't get it misconstrued, don't get this shit confused  I'm two seconds from prison food, I'm a different dude  Pistol in my reach, man, still in Long Beach, man Hoping if my grind don't help me get out, my speech can  I been in the streets longer than Yao Ming's wingspan  You can be MTV, I'll be C-Span  I deal with politics, bandannas and hollow tips  Half you rappers follow this, role models can swallow dick  Was stressed out over cash flow  Hip-Hop used to console my soul, now it's a bunch of assholes  Rap about a dance while I'm targeting cops  Spit some shit for Oscar Grant, hit the sergeant with shots  Make him a +ghost+ like he part of The Lox  I won't stop recording till I'm making songs harder than Pac's  If it don't happen, at least a nigga know he right there  Every memory under my Dodger hat's a nightmare  As a kid I had to steal breakfast  And now the best question you have to ask me, "Is this a real necklace?" "Where's your beat from Dre?" "Your feature from Cube?" These things leave people confused  Cuz they know I leave speakers abused, I eat the EQs  I eat through the beat, what's the secret? I think it's the shoes  Back in Cali, niggas blaze and stress  Waiting on Detox to save the West  Even if the shit is dope it ain't giving you niggas hope  Unless your signature's wrote on the check from Interscope, nope Move on The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Joe Budden Album: NBA 12" Song: NBA Typed by: Kingcrazyx@mail.com * * send corrections to the typist Shoulda never put me on this beat Okay, yeah, normal baller We back on tizzy, on top Jump Off, Dub B, Jersey Stand up GO!

I coulda guessed it, I was fuckin like a rabbit But I never saw him handle scoliosis like his dad did Never knew me and Ronnie would talk again Fuck a rhyme, I'm just happy that we talk again Who knew that the second I acknowledged you You would get terminally ill, be in the hospital The thought of you leavin is what fucks with me I'm scared to death of gettin full custody Nigga I look in the mirror disgustingly So how am I supposed to feel the day that he looks up to me? I always said you were the worst baby-mother I had ex-girl confused with baby-mother And there lies my problem with our creator All the times I wanted her black ass dead, you wouldn't take her Don't do it now, I need her Understand, it don't get no realer See how I go to bed with thoughts of a damn killer But rather show y'all my girl through these Instagram filters Look at her, don't look at me Cause if y'all judgin y'all would throw the book at me Speakin of shorty, nah I'll do that in private It might be a little soon for me to let her know how I get Shit, and now we right back at one Real quick, let me get back to my son When a nigga was like He said "Dad I'm weird, but I dont have a problem with that" And I was like haha, I laughed and I was like "Well #1, why do you think you're weird? And #2, why don't you have a problem with that?" And he looked me in my eyes and he was like "Well I say I'm weird #1 because I know I'm weird And I don't have a problem with it cause that's me and whoever don't like it they don't really have to be around me I'm comfortable with me and who I am" And right there, that was cold In my head I thought that was bold Illest shit about it all said that at 10 years-old So I could die right now I could die right now and feel like he got the most important part of Joe Or, better than that I could die right now and feel like he know all he need to know Joey...

You are now listenin' to The Growth (Look) This my guide to the rappers Before you go ahead and decide to be a rapper (Talk to 'em) I know you think it's +Money, Cash, Hoes+ But funny when that goes You'll be questionin' life after Like "why did I have to" (I know it) Seems like "yeah", seems quite clear But these maggots take your dream and make it a nightmare You been waitin' for some years But everything is fake, it's like a rear view mirror, nothin' is as it appears Can't trust people 'cause it's all about tryina succeed It's all about the backstabbin' and greed It's all about the wrong things Sucks, it's all useless And it starts to interfere with your love for the music (Damn!) Catch 22, most dudes'll give it all for their shot For most niggaz, this is all we got Should you quit the whole thing? 'Cause it's enough bullshit in the whole thing To almost make you wanna kiss the whole thing...(Chea!) Goodbye [Hook - repeat 2X] So long, goodbye Tired, of the game Let's get there [Joe Budden] Sometimes you think you better off with that 9 to 5 Til you remember all the times you got fired Sometimes you wanna dress down, walk out with no jewelry (But!)

It makes some wanna quit, it makes some stand tall If you don't sign that autograph, then it's one fan lost Sometimes you don't feel like it Everybody wanna be on you Sometimes you just wanna be normal Want the afore-mentioned Sometimes you don't wanna be mentioned Sometimes you just wanna blend in Might think the statement's weird When the world'll trade for your life (On some..) Real shit I'll trade for theirs Tell me now what's the answer When they know you had a death in the family And you still gotta smile for the camera You thought everything would be all to the good You ain't got as much money as you thought you would (Didn't blow!) Some people sell out, fuck everything they shot from their heart for that number one spot on the charts That's what it is, I can't paint it no clearer How you 'sposed to see straight when it's all smoke and mirrors? (All smoke and mirrors) Quit the whole thing, 'cause it's enough bullshit in the whole thing To almost make you wanna kiss the whole thing...(Chea!) Goodbye [Hook] Arrivederci! [Joe Budden] Just when you think you wanna go on without the hype Is when you go to do a show and see the crowd so hyped (And the...) Die hard fans say "you changed my whole life" So I sacrifice mine and gratify you with the rhymes (Yeah!) Folks from the hood, that see you as a stand out Outweigh the niggaz in the hood with their hand out And goin' 5 days a week with no sleep's A lot better than a cold park bench with no sheets So fuck politics, fuck inuendo (Oh!)

because I got enough problems and my solution is to stuff problems but if something goes wrong with that then it's back to pcp and solong with rap see I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands that I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feeling repressed lately but y'all been hearin and seein me less lately like it's anyone noticed the redress lately look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately seem disturbed, alot of repress lately I got a company that I'm signed to but they ain't in my company, when all I need is some company when I start feelin like everybody's done with me I tryna see what everybody want with me then the mistress, yeah, the girl from ten minutes it's hard now I'm needing ten minutes from heart I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know that I'll get into it, but I'll

check the shit, I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate it's not the whole hood that appreciates me what you gon tell me, when it's the streets that made me and I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me and then it's rap critics, they say all I make dance music but there almost anything you can dance to it they ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it they say he wines to much, he's too bitter they call it complaining, I call it explaining I know 'em niggaz cooked it, caught up in the gaming lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment some shit with me, a dude's been knew that but I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that rap ain't payin the bills, it's mo money mo problems or it's no money mo problems all enormous when you play at these stakes that's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face then the album's pushed back, cause they say he needs a single at the moment but what he needs is a single moment then I'm involved in the 'he say she say (that) send my mind on replay, each day then it's the bullshit that she save he's gave cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her she'll say anything psych, but I ain't wanna fuck her I don't feel good, so I won't wanna go to a club don't wanna go to a lounge, just wanna lounge then the same sweatster that I had on for days the same t I had on for a week what I got on, it speaks what I got on, it reeks no shape up, chilling, cause that's just how I'm feeling and one day at a time, it's god willing tryna see scrape but the fall keeps building post start raising, the booze starting that gate me but I gotta be a king cause this wolve's tryna play me goodie when it's hot like it's freezing winter bed start, eating sleep for dinner then it's hard tryna keep this in ya so I write it all down, so one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember then it's probation, I know we all go through it we call it probation, but there's no pro to it yeah my soul's aching, only a few peers know funny thing about the case is it's a few years old had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad so I'm sitting here like what the bitch had it's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true going what's popping, do he look happy to you now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter bruised up and sloppy, a damaged like Ali up late talking to the fans on a website that's the only thing that send yo man off to bed right fuck the world fuck my moms and my girl well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm this too won't last, this too shall pass at least that's what I say yall, that's what I pray for and I'm the only thing that's standing in my way yall but I

Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Joe Budden Album: Who Killed Hip Hop 12" Song: Who Killed Hip Hop Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com [Intro] [Joe Budden speaking] Yeah, I mean ah, I'm doin' all these interviews.  Everybody want to know what I think of the state of hip hop. Whether I think it's dead or not. Question ain't whether it's dead. It's more like, who killed it and when. Let' go. Can anybody pinpoint the day it when wrong? I mean, I used to blame Raggaeton I can't front I thought all that was corny Was it Ja's fault? Lil' Mo said she didn't get paid for +Put It On Me+ Look, bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit Was it T-Pain with that funny voice shit? Or was it Lil' Wayne with that funny voice shit? The whole game did grow that funny voice shit "I can't tell when it happened Was it when Lil' Jon showed dudes you can sell without rappin'? Was it +Laffy Taffy+? I thought they was kiddin' Shawty Lo said "No I really didn't."  "Dancing became cool again, Nick Can +Walk It Out+ But I didn't know what the fuck niggas was talking bout Unit kick Game out, they didn't give a fuck Then we seen the same shit happen to Buck It was a few years ago, but I remember the summer 50 made fans start looking at the numbers A&R won't take risks, they won't sign niggas The worst swag came out and started to blind niggas Rap dudes want reality shows And my dumb ass was thinking that reality sold Did it start with the Ipod Or when rappers had to pay DJs to do they job I mean all the content is the same it won't differ Everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers The more you think about it you gonna get sicker And why the fuck would Nas want to call his shit Nigger? Nigga Was it when it the Wu broke up? Pac, Big , Big Pun went to sleep and never woke up Lupe was doing a tribute and choked up And some of these stupid ass fans were like "So what?" Some of them, they ain't educated And fuck blaming the south, we ain't segregated I'm mean, it was all good around the Kiss and Beans shit Took a left turn around the kissing green shit Maybe it all started, when Rocafella parted Ways, it's natural to shift toward fame I watched every last dude shit on Dame Kinda got that in common, I can dig that pain When they gave Jay a desk and suit They finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute But somethin' told me the suits at the table was hurtin' They fired everybody and labels started merging As far as sales, they declining strong Ask the experts they'll say that the climate's wrong I'm mean some niggas prime is gone I peeped it when niggas started putting fake diamonds on You could tell a dude "I spit better than you" But then he'll say I'm richer for whatever I do I seen all this coming, I knew what we was in fo' Back when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window Was it when Ma$e retired and couldn't hack it? Tip could he just needed some more rachets DJs, producers wanted to get us the farthest Said fuck rappers and started becoming the artists I gotta talk candid Did we start having issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did? Was it when Chingy thought he didn't need Ludacris Next album found out that was ludicrous Papoose and Clipse both survived Inkin' with Jive Then getting jived Ya man J-Hood repped that D-Block gang Then I seen dude dragging his D-Block chain Or did one hit wonders change it all along They made labels only want to sign a dude's song And you really don't know shit If you think the fans pick the videos on 106 I'm just stating the truth Did it start when Fox stayed in the news more than she did the booth? Or was it when Lil' Kim stopped exploiting sex And fuck is up with DMX? I hope dudes straight Have an opinion and they're going to say "you hate" I can't front, I'm missin' them old Clue tapes The underground sunk further The Feds was on Irv so the Inc dropped Murder I never blamed Fab, Jeezy, Rick Ross The shit gets lost when Shyne went up north I never understand the hip hop police When hip hop is what hip hop needs to police These blatant ass radio attempts sound so bland Twista kept trying to recreate +Slow Jamz+ Did we send the wrong message with our slang As broke niggas spending their rent to +Make It Rain+  And you walk in give a bitch a few 20s And she'll smirk her face up, looking at you funny This chick told me see only take new money Man I snatched my shit back so fast Or did it start when rappers said "Fuck it" Sacrificed music, starting raping their budget Nothing wrong with dudes being candy or pop Something wrong when Joc did the +Candy Shop+ (Fuck is wrong with him?) We buying our own records maybe no one's to blame Are we a business that we can't afford to maintain? The second week show you that that boys numbers ain't hot I hate to break it to you numbers always lie Or when Ortiz signed to Aftermath And now he's feeling the aftermath Was it Fight Klub fucking with them battle raps But not many of them getting signed after that I mean, some can't stay afloat A million Busta albums, he's still not mentioned with the GOATS Fuck looking for answers Time will tell Was it when Def Jam didn't want to resign L? A 15 year old told me Cash? was ass But rather then smash on dude all I could do was just laugh Or was it when the whole east coast fell off? Or got comfortable, maybe dudes was too well off The more that niggas said that they didn't write their own lyrics The more it started to sound like it didn't But, do whatever you can to keep the lights on But dumbing down just became the new Dylan Honestly I ain't know what to think A few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink I can't blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing When we trained them to be this way I mean showed them whatever to sell with no limits Since the early '90's sold them a false image So when some shit come that don't fit the mold It's like a mole, nigga you won't even do gold They watch the videos  See you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you good They turn on the TV and see these video vixens  And think nigga's girls really look that good I mean they get so many free verses When the album drops shits more like a bonus Why pay for it, why take on this With one click of a mouse they can own it I mean some of them are fooled so easily By whatever we say or we show em on TV But that was all part of the plan Or was it when Eminem made 'Stan' I swear some of these fans They put their whole life on the line It's like they can't like more than one rapper at a time Less about the product, more about the digits It's a business, we got less fans and more critics Maybe we at a cross Canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost I ain't believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me That KRS One had a rap beef with Nelly If rap was alive We'd be trying to be the best rapper ever Not the best rapper alive But you won't get accepted at all if you ain't street tough Onyx was the hardest til Sticky got beat up Now I'm a thug is how I gotta behave If I wanna be paid, if I wanna see praise You know something is wrong when niggas is gettin shot And you gotta sit and wonder if the whole thing is staged It ain't real no more Or did we just expand on the audience, maybe we appeal to more Or Did we just think y'all getting dumber? We tried to make gettin' older gettin' younger Did we lose our hunger, somethings gotta give Did we out grow ourselves, is hip hop for kids? If it is, they turn on MTV cribs And think that's where these motherfuckers really live Or was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic So did the Fugees til Wyclef tapped it Songs don't do it no more, this shits shocking Seen it when +Lean Back+ had the whole world rocking Now it's fuck your bars if your hook is fly So we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye It's dope ass rappers that ain't seeing no dough If everything is commercial where the fucks the show But anybody making a dime, see I'ma wish well Still we took a big L losing Big L Or was it when Youtube came in the game Now nobody's from their living room can make a name Or when the indies like Koch came and blew up Niggas at the majors they literally threw up To some it ain't fun no more You know it's fucked up when DMC don't talk to Run no more Too many egos like we ain't one no more Shits predictable, niggas ain't stunt no more We started to see shit we never seen before At one point we even had the magazines at war Or  Was it street DVD's like Smack Showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act Did shit get lifeless When MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest Changed the whole stee-lo I mean the average fan never heard of a Goodie Mob or a Cee-lo But they've heard of Gnarles Barkley And Dr. Carter still say we got a heart beat I ain't gonna lie, I was scared to death straight up Started hearing rumors of an Outkast breakup I was like that ain't true, it sounds desperate Started seeing Big Boi and 3K separate Had periods we was dryer than the desert Are we all killing this shit, is it a group effort Are we alive and well or barely surviving Is it R&B's fault, them niggas is thrivin' And then a lot of people go and blame Limewire I don't think it's downloading, dog the lines tired Did the fans just get tired of the outcome One dope single and a bullshit album So they share albums with each other Was it Master P with them ugly ass album covers Or was it when we started appearing in the news Timberland said they ain't want black niggas wearing their boots I mean, I know it got foggy at least blurry When a label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray Or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names Had the kids trying to buy shit they can't name And some think the evidence is ample Did it start when Puff took advantage of the sample Is it all watered down with no fire If you had enough money you could buy a ghost writer Or the diamond district, Jacob The Jeweler Had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler And fucking with them trends Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain't even in Look, is the game now as bad as it's ever been? It's not ring tones just the songs that they represent I heard all of them Sad part, I wouldn't recognize most of these niggas if I saw em I can't explain it, i don't know what to tell ya Now going gold is looked at as a failure Maybe old heads in charge just weren't able DJ's are spinning now with no turn table Maybe the fans are just bored of us Or maybe there ain't enough room for all of us It's like, even a friendship will stop at a point Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug's joint But there's so many ways to get fucking rich Superhead kicked off just by sucking dick Did we sell out just to get in demand more Did we go against everything we use to stand for Both are likely There's two sides to the coin, who you rolling with Soulja Boy or Ice T Some niggas wanna sit around and complain about I'd rather analyze, seek how it came about If we could rewind the world We wouldn't have to watch Flavor Flav try to find his girl Look, today it's all about marketing and promo I remember VH1 was just for old folks But no ma'am  If I ain't know better I would think that mix show was now program We let the power of a dollar annihilate us How the size of our chain gon validate us? It's simple they can't think we really deep I just heard Chris Brown on the +A Milli+ beat Seen a video called +Looking Ass Niggas+ Grabbed the remote, tired of looking at niggas But that let a nigga know that if we ain't dead That we just half alive, maybe brain dead Did it start when Capone left NORE Nah he went to jail that's a whole different story Or maybe something really wrong with our ears Obie Trice got dropped, so much for Cheers Female emcees, they don't ever hit the target Somebody said they seen Amil working at a Target The sad part is we already lost Remy Or did we go wrong when E-v-e got Skinny What's up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga that I can't figure Trina ain't been the same since +Nah Nigga+ I know it had to do something to his heart beat When Lady Of Rage started doing Steve Harvey I know we caught a little trauma Somewhere between Yo Yo Boss and Lil Mama A lot of females found another way to extort Most of our video models have turned escort Do anything to see dough So they'll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role Or should we get back to basics Wheres the Rakim's or the Masta Aces? The Big Daddy Kanes, or did we never recover? From Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover Or when rap dudes started signing their friends Instead of going out trying to find niggas with skill I seen it when D-12 put out +Purple Pills+ While the whole hood laughed them niggas sold a mil Some of us ain't prepared for something so lucrative I just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit Like we almost caught one in the torso When each Bone Thug member took they own +Crossroad+ Some disagree, some gotta see the same Or maybe hip hop died on Aaliyah's plane If it relocated, where did it move to? I Still Love H.E.R. the way Common use to Or did Bill O'Reilly come fuck up the spirit With negative remarks about everybody's lyrics He spends all his time dissing us Nigga, you 95 years old motherfucker shouldn't be a listener Lost Jam Master who was Tougher Than Leather Or did it start when Treach was fucking Pepa As our jeans got tighter and our T's got longer Tryna figure out which age group we belong to Or did we all go astray The second Dr. Dre left N.W.A. In my opinion we was on easy streak When he was beefing with Eazy-E Or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat Signin' unknown niggas to start making their beats If you sell your own shit, it's gotta go for cheap Just put my name on it so the price increase Or is it cause everybody's so self centered Is that the reason hip hop itself ain't centered Or have we already seen the shit with our own eyes With +Rico Suave+, Cam and Vanilla Ice Everybody want in the game so in return You got label executives fucking they interns And anybody looking at that new Vibe Bracket Should see that they don't know a thing bout this rap shit Or maybe we should've stopped being proud When their was no more Rawkus and no more Loud Try to get conscience around Vote Or Die So they made it look like all our votes was lies As the years go on it's like we keep getting more voids We got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys I knew we was impersonating a fraud When Kay Slay smacked my mans at the awards Regardless it's our fault as artists Running with entourages who act like they ain't never left the projects Who do we wanna target? Will they put an Uncle Murda Cd in a Wal-mart or a Target We got the nerve to not wanna hear Ras Kass But fuck with Vick get silly and that trash I felt ashamed  When J-Kwon told me he didn't like Raekwon cause he stole his name Was back when everybody in the club got Tipsy Now every contract gotta be three sixty So fuck eating, better scrape the plate Now every beat gotta at least have an 808 Did the light skin jim when we first heard Mims And said another New York rapper on the south's tip Is it overcrowded They keep saying if it's so fucked up, then do something about it I doubt it, It's just one thing they don't understand That job is way bigger than just one man Or maybe all of these pleas that it's deceased Is false and this shit is right where it needs to be Maybe we built on something that'll last forever You see Face and Geto Boys just got back together Maybe no one can stop us Even other genres now jock us We even doing songs with the rockers Hows that the feeling? Kanye is amazing Wayne just sold a million, we closer to the ceiling God we in a coma When we the only business where you can excel with no diploma Technologies changed, made everything simple Myspace is now a dudes Bio/Demo Side from the fact we generating more money We took it global and penetrating other countries So lets celebrate, sip some Cris Some more shit we embraced just to end up dissed Go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent Lets go cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent Or here's another bright idea to entertain Lets go and put our face on the bottom of a chain Or some of us are just nigga rich with nigga money While Jews keep laughing lookin' at these nigga dummies Hip hop is just a stepping stool Til we find another role we can step into to Some of us doing movies as a matter of fact And some never stop the plan life after rap I mean ah As I'm older we stopped moving further Around the same time Snoop Dogg went on trail for murder Or was it Scarface creating these cloneys Thirty years later everybody's still Tony Maybe anyone complaining is deranged Can you expect something to grow and not change? Which results in our exceptions, deviated our old route To simplify the term, we all sold out I think I figured out who's to blame We started out Obama ended up McCain So we Kurt Cobained ourselves when we defeated So next time they asked you who killed it say WE DID The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: 3rd Storee f/ Joe Budden Album: Get With Me 12" Song: Get With Me Typed by: akademik_geniuz@yahoo.com * * send corrections to the typist [Intro: 3rd Storee] (2x) You should get with me If you get with me You should get with me If you get with me [Verse: Joe Budden] Lady, think I just wanna hug and squeeze?
