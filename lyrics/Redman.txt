About to set the vibes right He lit it with his finger, I smelled the Martian buddha linger I felt good cause I released some anger No sooner than the cease of the herb ignite I was headed back to Earth at the speed of light Upon my return niggaz thought I was in jail Nah kids...

I am in the house smelling like contra-band. I demand your mic in hand, seriously as a man run it.  Verse Five: Redman Ay yo, watch these 5 niggas stand up in triple pod. Circle back to back, scoping all angles. Why does hip-hop circumference start gettin' tangled? They drop 1 by 1 in the dark gettin' strangled. I come fresher than Summer's Eve please. Squeeze your wack-ass amphetamine rhyme drug-related. I'll make sure your loot and your wife and kids are confiscated. The lawnmower Red do damage to circuit breakers. Go ahead and hype them niggas up, let 'em go. Just a blow from the invincible will show 'em I'm original. Freeze, I'm like Baskin and Robbin I'm robbing Haagen-Dazs. And the whole Hit Squad target ain't nobody fuckin' with me. The potency that I blow from my mouth. Will no doubt choke Jeeesus. Travelin' around the world with no Visas or American Express. Just Jamaican excess (ha!). Can I impose on your cipher? Been rippin' shows since your moms was foldin' your diaper. Niggas see me up top dolo daily catch ease 600 V. On the mobile trailin' back to A.T.L. Swell some more heads with that Long Island sound. That be thicker than cornbread (money). Jersey tales from from the hood without Sonnny.
