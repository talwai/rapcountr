The same back then as I am today I can recall me, Jemel and Jamal In the room drinkin straight vodka with they moms When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm Back with the light blue camoflauge suit God me and Hav' doin it hard, tryin to get on We sampled songs on the box with record and pause Killer B didnt even get his first firearm And I was still holdin one shot derringers [Hook: Prodigy] Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce Sometimes I see a chick walkin past with ya kids Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-5th All the shit that we been through it boils to this? Dun, I wish we could start it all over again [Prodigy] Ninety-five, we on top tourin the states A lotta times we even took the click overseas Came along way from the hallway Sitting in the staircase with Bacardi Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang While we would share drinks with the other that came Triple L stayed takin they cash in dice games Killer Black grew to keep an ice grill, dunn was not playin Yammy, the most Infamous told me one day "Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P" But it was all love, we was eash others dunns We held each other down, borrowed each other guns Its hard to believe that niggas so strong  could die so easily forever be gone I could still feel the web of your palm, against mine  cause we did our hand shake all the time Why it have to be your time to go and not mines? Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin All the laughs we shared and fights we had All the nights we would get nice, damn Plates of food we split in half I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed [Hook] [Prodigy] What the fuckin deal, motherfuckin Scarface nigga, killer For Bean, Fugi, Gooey, (I can't take no more nigga), Corey Black Ed, the fuck, knahmsayin?
