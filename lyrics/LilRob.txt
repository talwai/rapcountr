At all these smiling faces... I don't trust them... I've got no one to depend on... Chorus B: Lil' Rob Ain't got nobody to depend on No tengo a nade Don't need nobody but myself Can't trust nobody Cause everybody that I've trusted, has done me wrong No tengo a nade Ain't got nobody to depend on (Verse 1) Some people have made up lies to read down and shed your name Smiling faces Smile in my face, but all this time, they wanna take my place Give me the pat on the back Then give me the stab in the back, tryin' to hold me back, now I'm back All these fools talkin' smack Figure that (I figure that) It's been this way Since junior high, everybody whisperin' shit But like I said before Jealousy was never cool, not even a little bit (???), you're phony But who's the one who hit the scene when I was sixteen With the bullet I was this close to do it, I know it, then I blew it, I was foolish (That's right) Kickin' back on the corner Smokin' a jay everyday Some things never change I'm still that way, in fact, today I got so blazed It was so magnificent First you saw it, then you didn't, I disappear like a magic trick, didn't have my magic sticks Then I Disappear in the smoke as you soak In your lies Lil' Rob lightin' up the sky like Fourth Of July (Like Fourth Of July) I can't believe myself How I could subdue and just deceive myself Chorus A: Lil' Rob Ain't got nobody to depend on No tengo nade Don't need nobody but myself Can't trust nobody Cause everybody that I've trusted, has done me wrong That's why this nice guy, has turned to wise guy Repeat Chorus B (Verse 2) Mistakes I know I made a few But I'm only human You made mistakes, too, I crease my Levis one leg at a time, just like you But you wanna keep talkin' shit Tellin' stories that are not true, it's ghetto Like a fossil, tryin' to cover your tracks, cause you'll be a rat like Donny Brosco (Rata) Now and then I lose my way, feeling like I never knew my way Thinking all them times that blew away, opportunities that I threw away If I had wings, I'd fly away And I would do this night and day Oh, by the way I like to play From Saturday Til Saturday It doesn't matter, ay What you say I was told "Don't let no one get you down and turn that frown Upside down" (Turn that frown upside down) Seems you can depend on me But I can never seem to depend on you I try and look you in the face But then again, it's the same, I can't see two What do I do? I'm so confused Til when someone's got to lose, I'd hate to be in your shoes I'd probably be dressed up in the county blues, singing the blues to the things that I choose Didn't I blow your mind this time, it was probably already blown Ain't got no one to depend on, homie Lil' Rob, what am I on? Repeat Chorus A & B (Verse 3) Everybody is somebody's fool, there's no exception to the rule (There's no expection to the rule) If there was a guarentee that the one you love (That you love) Is gonna love you But I refuse to be, like I used to be Everybody usin' me Watchin' over, that's cool with me I know what they want to do to me Only out to make a fool of me Don't try to be schoolin' me, please, cause I don't need to retire Throwin' dust at my eyes with speed, and making me feel like they were the ones that were dealing Appealin' to many, cause I'm the one that rocks steady If you're not ready, get ready, think this is it, I've got plenty  And I won't stop (Stop...) Til I see that pretty penny (That's heavy) Just like a Chevy on 20"s, hittin' switches I'm hittin' thirty-nine inches and leavin' you bitches in twitches While all you snitches be snitchin' and wanna be burning down bridges I got you twisted like robes, while I'm breakin' down on your hoes You make me laugh just like jokes, you fade away just like Ghost (Ha ha) You wanna turn you back on me, pero Esta bien (Ponle) Ain't got no one to depend on, homie No tengo a nade (Orale) Repeat Chorus A & B The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lil' Rob Album: Still Smokin' Song: Still Smokin' (Supermix Part 1) Typed by: CruisinInBlue86@cs.com * * send corrections to typist This is the MCI operator I have a collect call from..DREAMER Who is an inmate in a California State prison To accept charges press 5 now {beep} Your call is being connected Thank you for using MCI ESE, CHOLO!

But now, I want you To stay out of my life Repeat Chorus (Verse 3) Every time I find another love, and try to settle down And build my castle to the sky, you come and tear it down I treated you like a queen, how come I didn't feel like a king I told you if you lose me That you would be losing a good thing I'll always remember that day in September Cold as December Leaving behind a fool, such as I Teary eyed I guess you had your mind made up Now, you've got your fools mixed up Tore our off legs up, throw them on the ground for me to pick up That's the night you laughed at me Threw your little past at me Never thought I'd see the day, that you would see the last of me Fears of losin' you, kept me Holdin' on But I got strong You never know what you got until it's gone Cuando Te queria No me quisiste Cuando te fuiste, me dejaste triste Y te reiste De mi Ain't it funny (Funny...)

way Just another day, but I still like to play from Saturday til Saturday Some things never change, Lil' Rob remains the same Always and forever, I've got my mind together Now a lot better, tougher than leather Whether or not you agree, I'm from SD and I won't flee Gee what a guy, that's what they say C-H-I-C-A-N-O de San Diego Gotta give my Q-Vo's to all my primos out in Los Oh so far but yet oh so close I got you fiending, I think you need a dose Of that shit that got some of my gente dreaming All in my flows, nobody knows where it all goes But it takes it til the end, final countdown 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Boom boom, blowin up, blowin up is the outcome [Chorus 2X] I've got you fiending (fiending) for the flavor of the Natural High, Natural High, Natural High This is the outcome of me by my lonesome I take the beats and lock em down like Folsom My life was like a puzzle searching for the pieces Couldn't find the reasons now I'm bumpin for all seasons Can't nobody stop me, cuz people want me Hoping that my wicked past doesn't come back and haunt me No thanks to the ones who doubt me Don't know about me or my destiny But they keep testing me Thinking that they're stressing me But I pay them no mind My time is too expensive to fight young and all defensive I've learned my lesson over the years Don't pay no attention to jealous peers Fear keeps them going and going, I've got them fighting And they know that I'm knowing and so I keep on writting and writting But they keep on fighting to be the very best I just huff and puff and put that smoke up in my chest Not even trying to be number one But I'm real to myself so it's already done And this is the outcome [Chorus 2X] All of a sudden there was silence Not a care in the world, no sign of violence I'm flying high just like a pilot You would be to if you would try it I go insane when I can't find it My homey sells that's where I buy it I roll it up in a joint and then I light it It's just the feeling that I have And I can't fight it I'm so excited Delighted to show these fools that they ain't got the skills to do it They're like a mechanic without tools I got so much to lose but so much to gain to end it now Smoke Mary Jane to ease the pain Who has the last laugh now People wondering how, and so I tell them just like this When you're guaranteed to hit you're guaranteed not to miss Not even trying to be number one But what's done is done and this is the outcome [Chorus 2X] Yeah, and that's how it goes down Try to hold a man back he's bound to comeback twice as hard And that's exactly what I did While you're stepping on other people's toes Trying to get to where you wanna get I just sit back and huff and puff and put that smoke up in my chest Not even trying man, yeah The Original Hip-Hop

ain't got nobody to depend on Some people make up lies staring you down and shed your name Smiling faces all in my face but all this time wanna take my place Give me the pat on the back then the stab in the back Trying to hold me back now I'm back All these fools talking smack, figure that It's been this way since Junior High, everybody whispering shit But like I said before jealous was never cool not even a little bit I know you're phony, but who's the one who hit the scene when I was 16 with the bullet I came this close to do it but I blew it, I was foolish Kicking back on the corner smoking a j everyday Some things never change, I'm still that way infact today I got so blazed, it was so magnificent First you saw it then you did it Disappear like a magic trick with my magic sticks Then I disappear in the smoke as you soak in your lies Lil' Rob lighting up the sky like Fourth Of July I can't believe myself, how I could subdue and just deceive myself [Chorus x2] Mistakes, I know I made a few  But I'm only human, you made mistakes too I crease my Levis one leg at a time just like you But you wanna keep talking shit telling stories that are not true Let's get it on, like a possom you try and cover your tracks Cuz you'll be a rat like Donny Brosco Now and then I lose my way, feeling like I never knew my way Thinking all those times that blew away, opportunities that I threw away If I had wings I'd fly away, and I would do this night and day Oh by the way I like to play from Saturday to Saturday It doesn't matter ay, what you say I was told don't let no one get you down and turn that frown upside down See you can depend on me but I could never seem to depend on you I try and look you in the face but then again I can't see two What do I do?

Is it the L-I-L to the R-O to the B? Lil' Rob, say it for me loud How come I say my name so much? Because I'm proud Like the Impressions along with Curtis Mayfield too I'm so proud of you You know the jam, I'm the oldie man, some say I'm the only man  Who can make a rap jam without fucking up the oldie jam I always am and I always will be That one you love to hate and later on I'll still be People wanna kill me over all this rap shit Can't get over that shit, now they want me in a casket Rumor has it, that I'm one of the baddest Little vato rapperos with rhymes that are massive Gigantic and deeper than Atlantis You wanna be like me? Homey you better fucking practice When the birds no longer use their wings to fly That's when I'll stop stop stop stop stop When the rain drops stop falling from the sky That's when I'll stop stop stop stop stop When Old Broadway turns to Fifth Avenue That's when I'll stop stop stop stop stop When mathematicians find that one plus one isn't two That's when I'll stop stop stop stop stop Been doing this a long time, now I'm busting strong rhymes Know about the thin lines, trying to keep shit in line And I know it's my time, for some reason I'm not trying But without my music out homey I'm slowly dying That's something I know that they want Something that I don't want Lil' Rob the nickname, the nickname that they forgot Yeah he used to bust raps and make people clap Everybody's got their albums out, but where's his at? He said it'd be out a long time ago, he said that a long time ago Where'd all the time go? Can't see, like with a blind-fold Hey have you seen me, Mr. Whodini Say that I'll be back, but that's my disappearing act When the birds no longer use their wings to fly And the rain drops stop falling from the sky And Old Broadway turns to Fifth Avenue When mathematicians find that one plus one isn't two that's when I'll stop Remember when I was younger I would hunger for the chance to be a star Here we are, how bizarre, how far Will I take it, will I make it, have I already made it What'd you think about my album after you played it Was is good, was it bad, was it bad meaning good I can take this to the top ese, I really could We need more Mexicans on cd, more Mexicans on tv Never forget where I come from, and that's what keeps me Who I am, aw man it's you again, that man up in the mirror The only little vato that I fear Sometimes I don't like to see you, don't like to be you Wishing on a star of all the things that I could re-do See through, all you, are you, who you, say you

(Lil' Rob) Ever since I was about 12 that's when they documented me A gang member let me tell you my autobiography Ay I can't let it to be frenetic, it must have been genetic To get in trouble with the law take when I break I'm strapped from the balls that's what I use to do Smoking a joint or two Lil' Rob getting a little blaze Welcome to my concrete maze, remember the days I remember going to school, we meet by the track smoking a sack With the vato I sold it too, get him stoned Then I jack it back, remember the guero use to look at us all Funny and strange, cause my pants was bigger then theirs But now they all wear them the same I used to get jealous, wondering why I didn't have the same rights Is it because I'm running up and down, eating Menudo, frijoles and rice? Someone explain to me, all of this insanity I'm not understanding you, never understanding me When a minority, gets their priorities straight We become the majority, inflate Incredible rate, controlling our fate Controlling our states, and I can't wait Remember you told me I would never amount to anything That I'll probably be on the streets sellin mota or methamphetamines So what? It made me an extra buck when I was shit outta my life You'd do the same thing homie if you were stuck (Lil' Rob)(Chorus) And I remember, when times was easy That's what everybody says But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets But I still loved them (But I still love them) And had to have them. (And had to have them) And I remember! (Remember x3) Remembering the things we used to do The places we used to go (Lil' Rob) And I remember kicking under the street lamps, smokin a J Hearing my Homie say, Homie pass the joint this way And this was everyday and every night was the same We didn't call each other by our first or last, but by nicknames Dreamer, Peewee, Oso Negro to name a few One passed away, rest in peace The others locked away in prison blues One of the things we use to do Can't nobody take it away from us We used to live life dangerous, time flew away like angel dust Never known as presentado levas Stay away from metiches, and chepas Talking mentiras, cause they can't beat us Mira Lil' Rob on his lowrider bicicleta Looking for muñecas, beautiful like aztecas But when it comes to love, before the agony for the ecstacy What comes around goes around So baby don't mess with me don't be testing me Cause Lil' Rob be one of a kind original individual Unforgettable memorable indelible incredible inferable (Chorus) (Lil' Rob) Give all of my love to mi madre padre brother and sister And all of my sangre Enemies? Chale me vale verga estas afuera mirando padentro You wanna come in but you can't Cause we're not in love with no mensos Figuring it out like a pencil Treat one like a stencil Just when you think you've got a grip on life That's when you let go, ready set go It's a race to the finish and only the best gonna win this And I'm prepared to take it to outer limits or until it's finished business What is this? Gente becoming witnesses I don't know nothing, I don't hear nothing, I don't see nothing Something I learned as a kid Along with respect those who respect you Forget about the ones that will forget about you My recollection is a collection of a big section of mi vida Memories I need ya, like a junky needs his chiba I wish that I could go back and do it all over again But I know that that ain't happening, so I sit remembering  (Chorus) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lil' Rob Album: The Album Song: Saw You On The Dance Floor Typed by: xx_mr_makaveli_xx@yahoo.com * * send corrections to the typist [Chorus 2x] Saw you on the dance floor and I love the way you're movin' You sure know what you're doin' Hey girl you're turnin' me on [Verse 1] The girls all pause when I walk into the room Baggied up with cologne They're prettied up with perfume, I Feel like I wanna, strut my thing Baby girl, you wanna dance?

Saturday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday? Seems like time's going backwards like an hourglass going in reverse I'm bouncing off walls like rubber balls In my mind, dreams, nightmares and waterfalls Mary Jane calls my name, take me away As I float over my body and look at myself That can't be me, there's no way How could this happen to such a man with such a plan? Just when you think you're on top of the world and nothing can bring you down Believe me homeboy, something always can Seems like I'm sinking in quick-sand With nobody to lend a helping hand But I trust no hand to help me Even though I've helped many, they couldn't do shit without me All work and no play makes Lil' Rob a dull boy How could you live your life this way? Get up But the pain won't let up, the voices in my head won't shut up I feel I've been set up, I can't even pick my head up I sit paditonic, explode like atomic People think I'm on the shit, but I'm not on it All I wanted was to live a simple life But now I live this crippled life Had a bright future, gots my mind boggled Cuz now I look at my future through foggy goggles My room's getting smaller, and I'm getting taller Our Father who art in Heaven, I trust you with everything about my vida But I don't trust the Reverand, trust no man, trust no girl Turn something straight into a curl Collection of bad thoughts drives my brain insane Even with heart aches and migraines My pains and black and blue my eyes are bloodshot red I'm halfway to dead, I'm half alive I'm lost in the middle, trying to figure out a riddle That cannot be solved, as the world revolves How did I get myself involved? Sitting in the darkness, slipping into darkness How did I start this? Time to depart this As I sit in my four corner room Ain't got no room for nobody else, just for myself [War] As I sit, in my four corner room As I sit, in my four corner room As I sit, in my four corner room As I sit, in my four corner room The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lil' Rob f/ Eric Bellinger Album: Don't Wanna Fall In Love (Apple iTunes Release) Song: Don't Wanna Fall In Love Typed by: Wammy Giveaway Chorus: Eric Bellinger I Don't wanna fall in love Cause everytime I give myself She gives herself to someone else, that's why I say I Don't wanna fall in love Cause everytime I fall I learn that love don't love nobody At all [Lil' Rob] (Verse 1) I don't wanna fall in love no more, that word is for the birds How else can I say it, hmm, that word is to the curb Absurd, overrated, and I hate it, don't want it Don't need it, won't happen, believe it, I seen it And I've heard it Just when I thought that everything was perfect She with my best friend getting perverted Like I deserved it I started cursin', turning into a different person Had to evaluate the situation And not let it worsen At least that's my version I'm the one who got the hurtin' That's for certain, now it's curtains and I'll never love the same way twice Cause it ain't nothin' nice, and never ends up right I feel sorry for all those who are in life Refrain: Lil' Rob I know you say you love me But baby, no you don't I know you think you do now But later on, you won't You'll find another guy That's when you'll cheat and lie And then you'll say goodbye And that's the reason why Repeat Chorus [Eric Bellinger] At all At all I learned that love don't love nobody At all [Verse 2: Lil' Rob] She loves me, she loves me not, well, love is somethin' I ain't got I'm about to hit the block and have that stupid cupid shot {*cartoon gun shot*} Hey He shot me first And it was cool at first, until she found that other guy And then, it hurt What the heck is that about, I regret the day I asked her out Gotta make a brand new plan cause this one isn't pannin' out If love is in my path, then I'm a have to take a different route Cause all this heartache and sorrow, I could really do without Repeat Refrain Repeat Chorus [Eric Bellinger] At all At all I learned that love don't love nobody At all Repeat Refrain Repeat Chorus [Eric Bellinger] At all At all I learned that love don't love nobody At all At all At all I learned that love don't love nobody At all The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lil' Rob Album: Lowrider Boulevard Tour 2000 Song: San Diego Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com What's up ese It's you homeboy Lil' Rob Representing my city to the fullest San Diego, Southern California That's where I'm from, simon S-A-N D-I-E-G-O representado con Mano Lopalo Mi pa mi lado, Chicano liempo creased down with the wrinkles Bet you get them tingles when you listen to my singles Mi cate, pelonsito con marijuanito Got one hand on my quette and the other on my pistol Siempre listo, mijito en todo I'm one bad motherfucker from the wrong side of town ese, mi motto Pero no me jolles, but I still enjoy this Lil' Rob controla, fucking up this rola like a bomba on the boulevard Cruising with the 45's, got my loaded .45's still living this Crazy Life I lay low like a Chevrolet, Chevrolet And I bust my rhymes and they come away, come away And I been many places but it's not the same though L-I-L R-O-B, S-A-N D-I-E-G-O S-A-N D-I-E-G-O, E-G-O San Diego S-A-N D-I-E-G-O, E-G-O San Diego S-A-N D-I-E-G-O, E-G-O San Diego S-A-N D-I-E-G-O, E-G-O San Diego, Southern California Though my town ain't what it used to be It still means everything to me I used to have dreams to be, something is what it made of me Nothing like I used to see, drug deals everyday homey Overdoses?
