a long time I'm telling you cuz you can make them boys bleed nigga It's about time to get it homie I think these boys done forgot who started it Who started this I started this for all these Mexicans down south All I know is I bet these boys don't want none of this flow Hold up Grimm... man keep that shit My moms told me to keep my friends close But keep my enemies closer Like Scarface and Sosa Going to war with soldiers But hold your head high  Ain't gonna lie Staying alive is harder than you realize Going to be a day to die Still I'ma try Cause I got the hood up in my veins And it's pumping through my body Collision course Runaway train Some of the same mother fuckers that I'm running with Got that gun on the hip And if I won on a lick Who you think they coming to get Dumber than shit I'm going to hit Anyone that want to plex S.E.H T-X Who going to hate me next I got the means to make the most of every move you make  You need to choose your fate Don't be no fool and wait Hesitate in this game and you're gone Niggas paid just to aim at your dome Everyday I pray to get home I got my blade and my chrome And I'm known for getting blown So ignite the flight And those who heard it dropped the mic Don't believe the hype This is for the hustlers and this is for my G's This is to them bustas that try to take my cheese I got too many youngsters that's out there on the streets And we doing what we wants to Now watch the block bleed (x2) It's no mystery when I'm in ride mode It's Cuervo and hydro Watch the man apply those  Skills that let me highroll Down low Deep inside the south is where I'm from Number one done got you stung From the motion of the tongue Looking sprung like a fiend Weighed my dreams on triple beams Made the team plush cream Lifestyle at fifteen Flipped my money faster than I could spend it Some got jealous some offended What was started never ended When did you get the idea That I was supposed to play the bitch Taping hits Taking flicks All and not to make it rich Made the switch Now I'm just stepping Ain't no looking back Knowing that the game Ain't no different than the cooking crack Crook to Mac That's my life in a phrase Hard feelings I don't got them  Looking for the better days Bet it pays And if it don't well I did my best Just a sinner in the flesh Tell me can I get my rest This is for the hustlers and this is for my G's This is to them bustas that try to take my cheese I got too many youngsters that's out there on the streets And we doing what we wants to Now watch the block bleed (x2) I raise my right hand  To the man and pray that he help through the day I know it's times if not for him  That I'd be dead and on my way For every bullet in the night That missed me whistling passing by Turning my eyes toward the sky Thank the Lord that I'm alive Other times out on the streets Them fading fools that bring in heat Paid the crew to make the creep And take that fool out in his sleep Now don't blame me for the way it is In this day of doing business I could ask for my forgiveness But I can't act as if I'm sinless What I know is in can only be as strong is my weakest link I can lead that man to the water But it's up to the man to drink Now stop and think before you sink Within the time it takes to blink Tattooed tears fall from the eyes Made with homemade ink This is for the hustlers and this is for my G's This is to them bustas that try to take my cheese I got too many youngsters that's out there on the streets And we doing what we wants to Now watch the block bleed (x2) The Original Hip-Hop

Mom's had a frown since the man went down Kites fly penitentiary bound and lil' man's left to hold his ground Playin' his art stayin' in school .. Nothin' short of payin' his dues Mamas heart's what made him choose ..  Got him a start in breakin' rules Hittin' them books hangin' with crooks .. Watchin' out when that law man looks Money's put in them pocket books  And business good 'cuz he got them rooks To make the run getting' it done ..  With the advantage of bein' so young Nobody cared about what had begun ..  Then by the end of '91 He was the kid in junior high   Lookin' to get some new supply Got him a hook up through some guy  Livin' like either it's do or die Under the influence of the game ..  Already been through the love and the pain Feelin's to him that one in the same ..  Gotta maintain or go down the drain It was the life he learned to live ..  He's never had an alternative Most forbid the things he did ..  But what would you do if you were the kid growin' up  Around the cut only exposed to what's corrupt Nothin' could break a boy so rough  except the touch of his mother's love [verse 3] Around the summer of '93 ..  Everyone's packin' artillery Do many wantin' to be a "g"  Ready to make a delivery Whatever it took to get in a set ..  Not even worried about regret It's who could pose the biggest threat  And catch the most of all respect He can't stop ..  He won't stop ..  Even though every spot is hot Givin' it everything thing he's got ..  Tryin' to keep from getting' caught Never the one to be any place  Long enough to catch a case After all no time to waste  When doin' your business face to face He's comin' equipped to make the lick ..  Not about to play the trick Puttin' in work to make the hit and keepin' it low to stay legit Mom's and dad's i'm talkin' to you ..

right now I'm either dead or in prison I'm writing this words as my daughter sleeps I pray this is something I never have to read The year is two thousand and I've signed with Universal All the hate

tell them that I know how they feel I never had both of my parents I was three when he left, and ended the marriage Most things I rap about, I no longer do Tomorrow is church and after that is the zoo Diamonds and cars don't make a man happy Your jewels in life are your friends and family The more money I make, the more problems appear I feel my enemies are closing in getting near Inspired by jealousy they wish me the worst I shook the hands of men that want me stiff in a hearse But everything I do, is so that one day Our kids can see their own kind in a positive way Although I'm no angel in God I do trust I'd like to take a second to tell you about us Rasheed is from Philadelphia, Low-G is from Honduras I was raised with my guela in a place called Falfurrias But we're all the same

Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear? Are you really true, baby is it destiny? Are you the one that god made and he meant for me? [VERSE III  SPM] I've broke many hearts in the days of past And they told me one day one will break yours back And avenge all the girls that you left in tears But my heart was too hard to ingest those fears So I ran through a bunch, some snack, some lunch Some was dark, some was yellow like Captain Crunch And we laughed a bunch, and we balled at malls And if I could, I'd apologize to all of y'all Saw the pain in her eyes as she begged me to stay And, now, I truly understand how she felt that day 'Cause now I feel the same and I want it to work Hopin' I don't end up like the ones that I've hurt [CHORUS  SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2] Is it real, tell me are we real? Are you just sayin things that I want to hear? Are you really true, baby is it destiny? Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?
