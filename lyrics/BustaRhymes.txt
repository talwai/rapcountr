But I'm sayin' Even though we probably link up every now and then With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend Something I realize is that I don't even have to mention Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately See you was here, when it started to haywire You're still here, walking with me going through the fire And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too On everything that I believe and I appreciate you And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out But I thank you for just being there and for hearing me out I got a clearer view I thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you [John Legend] I made a decision Despite all the things that we go through I'm gon' to take my time with you And be a friend indeed I made a decision Everything's gon' be alright Going to stay strong and keep it tight I'll be there indeed I made a decision [Common] I look in your eye and I see the pain in it Life's a game, maybe the game did it I know I changed, they say the fame did it Life has changed, maybe the game did it Two friends, now in two different places And the mister catching planes, and you catching cases Friendship, we never based it on position No matter the game, we both shared the same vision Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us I would come to town and never get up, with you Around then, things weren't so simple I had my own issues that I was trying to get through Outside chatter, messing with our mental On the chase of funds, trust, you can't forget to It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to No matter how far, just know that I'm with you [John Legend & Jamie Foxx] I made a decision Despite all the things that we go through I'm going to take my time with you And be a friend indeed I made a decision That everything will be alright Going to stay strong and keep it tight I'll be there indeed I made a decision...

Where you think you goin, nigga. Come back here. Y'all niggaz ain't seein Jack. Shit !!! [Verse 1: Baby Sham] Aiiyo, speak the truth. Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin hertz. Freestylin of the hum of the birds. Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind. It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin my lines. Hotel asks a nigga: "Could I share my dimes". Picture that, when you scared to draw toes. Playin me close. Rollin with the dogs wearin yesterdays clothes. Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition. I started dissin, hopin you listen. Pay attention. Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood. You wanna switch up because some niggas stalked you up. Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin with us. Left you all draged, like two trains crashin it up.

Scoffer booves. Now low muscles moves. Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels. Son gets school, wit the dummin crew. Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves. Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you. Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh. And me the most wanted fool. Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves. Snatch colors loose. A dollar rule. Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it. Till you cause fridget. Local or long distance. Gets master served. And crash a burn Like James Evans when I'm blowin. Fuck is wrong wit cha. Where you think you're goin. Where you think you're goin. Where you think you're goin.

Eminem might do If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after ?DeBars? got slapped When Doc say its a wrap.. (its a wrap) Its still Aftermath, and ain't nothing after that [Verse Two: Game] I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed And even though sometimes I run loose You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef But you told me it was okay to say "Fuck The Police" Now its my turn to carry the torch.. And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source Remember when we got drunk, to do 'Start From Scratch'? I told you.. you was like a father to me.. I meant that Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plats Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track When Doc say its a wrap.. (its a wrap) Its still Aftermath.. and ain't nothing after that... [Verse Three: Busta Rhymes] See when the world is on your shoulder.. and the stress grows bigger The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga Most of the time I let 'em know.. I dont agree wit' what he do But he a hardhead Dre.. thats why I'm talkin' to you See.. when I first met my nigga.. son was layin' in the cut Type reserve, homie was quite and kept his mouth shut Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck As time went on, now he was workin' with the finest I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance You gave him something that can make or break a nigga.. you should face it So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction The only was.. our little nigga wouldn't listen But when Doc say its a wrap (its a wrap) Its still Aftermath And ain't nothing after that...

And if you ain't tough don't wear my logo. And if you ain't fly you can't play with my yo-yo. Cause who's pockets is fattest matters. I'll serve famous Keith Murray's beef curries. Scattered rappers on platters. For tryin' get at us knowing we the baddest. With major operation, mental observation status. I used to love her then I got some common sense. Now it ain't funny, the bitch better have my money (word up). Verse Four: Jamal Lace the chronic with the bomb-bah. Hash the tye, blaze 'em up 1 time for my partner in crime. Who can I on my hip (why) cause niggas trip. Pull a burner all you know is a murder occured. A curb swerver wana be server/ baller. Got dome call hauled to the mortician for silly ambitious. I'm nice and precise, hard like rock. You shook like dice and pop like glock. Amy shit knock the shelves (yo, yo). Witness this nigga ro, trigga flow, digga ho. Niggas ass out, passout, excessively. Fuckin' with this manic-depressive will be the lesson of your life. Spoiled rotten and plottin' and double shottin'. Packin' always rapping but smacking a lot of action. I am in the house smelling like contra-band. I demand your mic in hand, seriously as a man run it.  Verse Five: Redman Ay yo, watch these 5 niggas stand up in triple pod. Circle back to back, scoping all angles. Why does hip-hop circumference start gettin' tangled? They drop 1 by 1 in the dark gettin' strangled. I come fresher than Summer's Eve please. Squeeze your wack-ass amphetamine rhyme drug-related. I'll make sure your loot and your wife and kids are confiscated. The lawnmower Red do damage to circuit breakers. Go ahead and hype them niggas up, let 'em go. Just a blow from the invincible will show 'em I'm original. Freeze, I'm like Baskin and Robbin I'm robbing Haagen-Dazs. And the whole Hit Squad target ain't nobody fuckin' with me. The potency that I blow from my mouth. Will no doubt choke Jeeesus. Travelin' around the world with no Visas or American Express. Just Jamaican excess (ha!). Can I impose on your cipher? Been rippin' shows since your moms was foldin' your diaper. Niggas see me up top dolo daily catch ease 600 V. On the mobile trailin' back to A.T.L. Swell some more heads with that Long Island sound. That be thicker than cornbread (money). Jersey tales from from the hood without Sonnny. And I know niggas want me. That's why my blade keep me company. Slice your neck, stick my arm down your throat. Rip out your artichoke.
