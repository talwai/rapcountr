an uncle leaving syringes stuck in his veins Heroin dreams, cocaine wishes Seen a dope fiedn suck a dog's dick for a fix and It's twisted and sick on this immaculate planet on which we live That's why I keep a black bag of ammonia by my side ever since Hollow tip shells, one in the chamber Sign my name in blood, smudgen the paper Too many crab motherfuckers and haters Looking at me like I fucked their moms Till they wind up hog tied in the trunks of their cars It ain't no sunshine, I can smell the jealousy and envy You're thinking my glass is half full, I'm thinking it's half empty I think above the law, surpass insanity Smear your blood on the wall like the Manson family Wtahc your mouth you don't know me homie Ill Bill, inappropriate like holding a baby, smoking a bogie Blow your

things from an uncle leaving syringes stuck in his veins Heroin dreams, cocaine wishes Seen a dope fiedn suck a dog's dick for a fix and It's twisted and sick on this immaculate planet on which we live That's why I keep a black bag of ammonia by my side ever since Hollow tip shells, one in the chamber Sign my name in blood, smudgen the paper Too many crab motherfuckers and haters Looking at me like I fucked their moms Till they wind up hog tied in the trunks of their cars It ain't no sunshine, I can smell the jealousy and envy You're thinking my glass is half full, I'm thinking it's half empty I think above the law, surpass insanity Smear your blood on the wall like the Manson family Wtahc your mouth you don't know me homie Ill Bill, inappropriate like holding a baby, smoking a bogie

Chewing Start a movement, Keep doing what your doing Niggas are straight, We like Shar Pei in prestigious face Love diamond rings and apes, Big money, Coffees and tapes Play'n, You get sprayed in the lake Hog tied and scraped, Chop fingers off you and skate That's the breaks, Wipe body S's, Escovitch fish With a Spanish blessing ________, The more I make Live through the babies, Busting my gun for sure This is Paidees, Somebody gotta die today B Ros pouring, The hardwood floor, Incents The crisp three-eighties, Gallons of French shit Pour more my niggas, Eat up, This is like peanuts Catch us in cells somebody beat up With only one class, A piece of hash, Tiny bit of reefer Fresh sneakers, Stressing for ass Write mad letters in slabs, Niggas'll be home shortly Keep cool, The niggas get bagged We live a poor life, Rich in the heart, Kitchens is dark Cooking white, Polices, Bitches, And narqs Foul play yo, Big guns and cigar The message repent them sins, Quick fast then mention Allah [Joell

I guess it ain't. What a shame I don't slang. Never slung but I'm one with the slum that has a name well fitting Plenty cheese getting.

Go show them that we're more than slanging raw." That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression And I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson  That the morals that you think you got go out the window When all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis And your child is down on her knees praying hard up to God for a whopper with cheese Do you B) hit the street hard with a flair  Or do you A) go to school for heating and air? Dare make an honest living or make a crooked killing Or do a bit of both until you're holding on a million? Brilliant.

jungles of concrete Waitin on the next victim Fuck rap, Macks and techs spittin Hatch in the back in the Lex liftin Forever Mya reppin for projects and prisons Poppin seven hundred dollar bottles of Coogi White The champagne cost a fortune Sky's the limit when we celebrate Ties with killers, Niggas sellin cake Jewels, Bananas come'n out of Jake Even though we stay fly, Nothin sweet but the cologne We marry the streets in holy matrimone Never take this ring off my finger The block'll get jealous of course Now I'm smile'n at your corpse The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to
