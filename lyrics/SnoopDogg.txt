On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name To make it interesting it's me, peep game I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad And two step-brothers who treated me bad I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores My brothers, they used to boast and brag: "We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!" And even worse than that, to make me feel low They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows Girls used to say, "Snoop, you're so cute But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit" Welllll, one day, up the Avenue There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all! The princess is having a royal ball If you can rap, also dress fresh You might win a date with the sweet princess" Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad I said, "Step-dad, may I?" And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cinderfella!) My brothers were goin, they were gettin down Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!) They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted "We can and you can't," is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah) They all stood there, laughin in my face And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!" (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss And I'd get them back if I had one wish Before I could make my thought a phrase There appeared a man from a puff of haze He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word! Now I've came here with the main purpose Of granting you your fondest wish" I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest" With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit On my feet was some white tube socks And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock I showed him my sack, and don't you know With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe Once again his hands began to flow Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!) He checked me over, passed me the keys And said, "One more thing before you leave... You must return before the stroke of twelve Or you'll turn back into your old self" (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love I jumped in the low-low and went on my way I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say It was after eleven when I rocked the mic And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!) The princess was starin, while holdin a drank Reflected from her eyes was gold tank She waved her hands like, "Hello! Hi!" Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!" I left the stage, girls came in flocks The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock No time to waste, I broke out in haste The princess followed in a futile chase A quick steady pace is what I kept Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps For the six-fo' I continued my stride About this time I heard gong five I was down the block when I heard gong eight And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!" (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love I was almost home when my luck ran out And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout My fresh low-low, also went too And there was no denyin that my night was through The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded Made it to my pad, no time at all Went to my room, or better yet the far wall Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's Early the next mornin, when I awoke I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat Slid into the front, my family stared at me Sayin, "Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be" They kept askin me if I did my chores My butt was saved by a knock at the door "Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked "The princess," this sweet voice remarked She said she was lookin for a certain man Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand The family ran around with their heads in the air Bringin her shoes from everywhere She just shook her head, a nod of relief And said, "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief" I ran in the room and got my shoe And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?" Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?" I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light And I was wearin shit, from just last night Looked out the window, saw the six-fo' Yelled to my family, "I've GOT to go!" We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I And in back of me, I heard my family cry... (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!) And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end So next year we can do it all again Same dogg channel, same dogg time Only the strong will survive in 99 So

Tommy Boy got caught If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease [Daz Dillinger] When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy His parents died left him with gangit kinds of money But Tommy was a hustler from around the way Stayed on the northside of town, is where he say He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever If the situation was bad it can only get better He ran around the dope house [Snoop Dogg (Daz)] So he put us up on his scheme He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team (Uh, poor

With trumped up charges against my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts of flexing his G's, popping his P's dotting his I's and crossing his T's. The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit in the Game Court. With trumped up charges against my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts of verbal and reckless endangerment from the million dollar mouthpiece; and leaving these super-sap suckers,  discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice. The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit in the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg,  Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game. Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system. Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather,  bring him before 12 G's and open up his files and you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup his tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll and charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension. So all you jerks with them $11 words comin out of your $2 mouth about a multi-million dollar Crip who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant, and the tongue of a mack - I said,  he's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars while you suckers is lookin for stripes.
