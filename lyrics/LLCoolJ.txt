The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LL Cool J Album: Radio Song: I Can't Live Without My Radio  Verse 1  My radio, believe me, I like it loud  I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd  Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat  While my JVC vibrates the concrete  I'm sorry if you can't understand  But I need a radio inside my hand  Don't mean to offend other citizens  But I kick my volume way past 10  My story is rough, my neighbourhood is tough  But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush  My name is Cool J, I devastate the show  But I couldn't survive without my radio  Terrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass  I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face  My radio's bad from the Boulevard  I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd  Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme  Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind  Cos I play everyday, even on the subway  I woulda got a summons but I ran away  I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  But I know I can't live without my radio  Verse 2  Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block  I really don't care if you're jealous or not  Cos I make the songs, you sing along  And your radio's def when my record's on  So get off the wall, become involved  All your radio problems have now been solved  My treacherous beats make ya ears respond  And my radio's loud like a fire alarm  The floor vibrates, the walls cave in  The bass makes my eardrums seem thin  Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back  You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac  Cos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed  And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes  My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast  The level on my power meter will not decrease  Suckas get mad, cos the girlies scream  And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean  I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  But I know I can't live without my radio  I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  And I know I can't live without my radio  Verse 3  Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset  Might go into a fit and rip off your neck  Cos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play  I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J  Let your big butt bounce from right to left  Cos it's a actual fact this jam is def  Most definitely created by me  Goin' down in radio history  I'm good to go on your radio  And I'm cold gettin' paid cos Rick said so  Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch  Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis  But it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'  And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'  My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock  Circulating through your radio non-stop  I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette  And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject  Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold  And jams like these keep me in control  I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  And I know I can't live without my radio  Verse 4  Your energy level starts to increase  As my big beat is slowly released  I'm on the radio and at the jam  LL Cool J is who I am  Imma make ya dance, boogie down and rock  And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot  And to expand my musical plan  Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands  That's right, so don't try to front the move  As you become motivated by the funky groove  You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block  With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock  See people can't stop me, neither can the police  I'm a musical maniac to say the least  For you and your radio I made this for  Cool J's here to devastate once more  Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs  If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!  Here to command the hip-hop land  Kick it live with a box inside my hand  I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  But I know I can't live without my radio  Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out, cool  out, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at. The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LL Cool J Album: Radio Song: You Can't Dance Typed by: OHHLA.com He man, I've seen ya, think ya rockin' it on the floor... You look like a moron! Who let you in the door? To put the question bluntly: maybe your feet's deformed They should slap you in the teeth when you put your dancing shoes on You can't dance! Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor? Homeboy, what's the use? Anytime you wanna step inside a party first think of an excuse You dance like a fat old lady not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice but every time you try to get one move right the old lady done did it twice You can't dance! You big no dancin', disco disaster the worst I ever saw They should drop kick you in the neck and drag you off the floor In every discotheque, I see you there in the middle of the crowd looking like you got eight or nine left feet dragging all around You can't dance! Take my advice, don't move! You'll never get the knack If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party and wouldn't be coming back On the floor you're a dinosaur, yeah boy, that's how you move You look like Ralph Kramden or a Donald Duck cartoon You can't dance! You wanna come to my party? I wouldn't give you a chance You tried to take breakdance lessons ended up in an ambulance Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold? You dance like you got arthritis already what'll happen when you get old? You can't dance! Why are you so stiff? Is it something that your mother did? Maybe you grew up around "can't dance" people when you were a "can't dance" kid You live in a "can't dance" house went out in a "can't dance" car your doofy "can't dance" father got drunk in a "can't dance" bar You take a "can't dance" bath put on your "can't dance" cologne Go out to a "can't dance" party so you wouldn't have to "can't dance" all alone You can't dance! Homeboy, will you please get off the floor, you moron?

Chorus  Dear Yvette x4  Verse 2  I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was  I'd have to treat you like you was my distant cuz  I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume  What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom  You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone  The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was "Moan".  Repeat chorus  Verse 3  I don't really know if the story is so  I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe  or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe  Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho  In every disco you say hello  Like you're a little angel, but we all know  Since you was eleven you been actin' this way  You always got in bed when you wanted to play  You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva  Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver.  Repeat chorus  Verse 4  You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro  A high-powered body makes your Levis grow  See the stories I've heard, they could amaze  I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days  So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.  That's a General Education on Decency  One day you'll see, and agree with me  unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93  For you there's no fee, everything is free  This is from me to you, not you to me  Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight  You try to shake your butt with all your might  I don't really wanna dis nobody  You might think I had a little too much Bacardi  But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette  How bad can a girl's reputation get?  See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met  If you're desparate ask Yvette, cuz she'll say "Bet".  Repeat chorus  Verse 5  B-Boys are hard on the boulevard  The Reverend at the church said you was barred  Homeboys on the block love you a lot  You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not  So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'  let me explain to you who is talkin'  I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way  You boogie down to my records almost every day  Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still  You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill  Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.  The guy at the desk said it was OK  for you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay  Greg G. and Garfield yelled "Hooray"  Repeat chorus x2 The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: L.L.

Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore You want more of what you used to ignore During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me Make love at night, coffee in the morn' I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm Cause I never met anyone like you before And I can give you more I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight But my agony continues till it reaches night Sweet image of your face appears on the wall And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall I look at the sky, then I search for the moon Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon So I dress to impress, exit the house Go up to the school and watch the kids come out In the middle of the court yard there you stand With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand Cause I never met anyone like you before And I can give you more You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction You won't get used if you follow my instructions Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan And that'll be eroticism, highs die down You will find your best friend finally is found I caress ya at night like a virgin in white Cause the new world I found is oh so tight And tender and young, soft and wet It's hotter than any fantasy could get Cause I never met anyone like you before And I can give you more The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LL Cool J Album: Radio Song: Dangerous Typed by: cjross32@hotmail.com [LL Cool J] His realm is a new horizon of cuts They expand from his hand as he conducts A melodical project, not photography Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography [LL Cool J] The lyrical virtuoso makes his return All adversaries should be concerned LL Cool J is back again Allow me to introduce you to my friend, Cut Creator [LL Cool J] He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave In his division, he'll endure any collision Like a surgeon with a scalpel, he'll make an incision As for me I'll annihilate, exile, ex-communicate you from rappin' and my lyrics are the best Slow down the rap but not the subject matter All you sucker DJ's will scatter Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy Choreographer of cuts, Cut Creator is his name The boys' so nice, my vocals will strain You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains To arrange scratch patterns full of audio change Not trigonometry, or fundamental geometry Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous (*"I Need A Beat" - cut and scratched*) [LL Cool J] Yeah I made it, don't look astonished I had to remind you of what I accomplished My scenario for your stereo us being beat, zero is the ratio Cut-Creator, LL Cool J Say "Ole", to what we display Battles - we don't evade, instead we invade and all competitors will be slayed Any comment is a compliment No groups' talent could be the equivalent of mine and his combined Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme So {?} is erased by the depth of the bass Takin' out every sucker DJ in the place A performance underrated, is now narrated So Cut Creator's social status can be elevated He's dangerous [LL Cool J] Demolishin' DJ's in under a second I'll quote an old phrase from my last record The beat elevates, the scratch excels Except I came here to raise some hell Servin up slices and cuts like a blade He could squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool-Aid Acute and steady, the record turns steady Instead of a needle, he uses a machete His cuts evolve to get you involved As the record revolves, DJ's dissolve Musically, physically, mentally, he's an innovator, greater Cut Creator is on the crossfader So try to digest what I invent On Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego Je pan de la francais, and Italiano From my projects and I'll inject Into your ears, a new concept Conceived in silence, to be unveiled to the Cool J phenomena, all must hail I'm dangerous (*LL Cool J freestyle*) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LL Cool J Album: Radio Song: Rock The Bells Typed by: l_rec@email.com L.L.

L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place  I wanna take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face  You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games  I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  Movies, records, goin' on tour  Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor  Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill  Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill  See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God  I have experience in goin' all the way to the top  It's harder harder than hard  All the suckers are barred  You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  See the problem is you want what another man has  His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz  But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own  cuz when you're rich you got friends  but when you're poor you're alone  So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul  Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old  Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me  why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?  Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three  A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life  you'll say "I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife"  Every day is a chase, every day is a race  and every day you're being overpowered by my bass  Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace  It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face  I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead  I'mma lead you away from drugs and petty crime  Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  Lead you to that ticket line  so you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  Get busy, not dizzy, wanna teach the young  The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung  Not that I killed him, it's just  He didn't wanna trust  the words of a master that's why you must  Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear  Don't try to say you can't hear cuz the words are clear  Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest  You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  Cuz tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight  Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right  E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck  If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck  L.L. Cool J is on the microphone  tellin' all you punk ducks "Leave me the hell alone"  Cuz I'm rated X, born to snap necks  Straight up and down, no special effects  I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean  If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens  Cuz that's where I live, and this is what I give  Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives  They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan  like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'  Here I am, tellin' the truth  and I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth  It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam  I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans  All you petty MC's in the state of New York  Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still wanna squawk  Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'  Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  Your mic sounds weak, remember that skeezer  I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar  I'm a hitman, but I'm not for hire  Fly girl's desire, the man you admire  Not only on the stage, I rock in the park  and I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark  So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound  L.L.

I AM - HARD - AS HELL Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn' Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks With hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot So I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot Jumped out, dried off, put on the Denim cologne Then I called up Earl on the telephone He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on 10 g's plus a limo for one strong song So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared Got a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon 12 o'clock came, left the door crack The freak walked in, a mink on her back Put her curt on the rack, threw my ??? on Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm We drank Roundhill Cavern, ate soft mignons She said, "L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?" My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail Did it so hard I shoulda went to jail She left, Earl came over and we went outside Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride Went up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel I'm not a sucker on the corner tryin to scrape up a meal The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex But those who flex end up with broke necks Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks Said, "It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic" Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door Due cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob Don't run from the cops, makin suckers jock And I'm only 18 makin more than your pops Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys And I dare any critic to call it noise Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03 Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake Thinkin 'bout a 100'000 that I'd soon make Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door Since tonight is a bore I'm in the mood for more We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam With thousands of people screamin, "Touch my hand!" But since I had a hour plus a half for tat I was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match Her name was Renee, her face was okay But she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play I said, "No need to rehearse," then I made my approach Said, "You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach" Said, "My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce Wanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it Forget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it Unplug your clock, do away with the light After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!' Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy When we make love you can call me daddy I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee I'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack After that I leave you starvin for me to come back But in the meantime, put your digits down And the next time I see ya I'm goin to town" Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks They said, "L.L., you're runnin late and it'is time to rock" Told Cut Creator what the order would be Then I said "Lord have mercy" and slapped hands with E Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream Aahh!

One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) That's all you get Physical and mental, those are two different loves Physical's a moment, mental is forever If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together You gotta be strong and endure the hard times Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow And when you're kissin and huggin and makin love treat that person like there's no tomorrow One shot (one shot at love..) One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) That's all you get baby; one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) One shot at love, one.. shot.. (one shot at love..) That's all you get {*sniff*} Jealousy - don't let it interfere Don't let it come in between the love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God So merciless and mean And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships and pit two people against, one another And because of this God, the one you love so much will no longer be your lover One shot (one shot at love..) Aww baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..) That's all.. I hope you understand what I just said All I'm sayin is that you only get one shot at love in life and you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad Take it from me You only get one shot, and I mean that One shot 	You only get you only get you only get one (2X) 	One shot at love..

I got play, here, let me show ya" Used to have a girl that was on the ball When the cash flow got low, so did her calls Used to have a homeboy, always chillin My cash went low, he told me I was illin And don't call cause he don't hang with derelicts Broke with no cash, yo, I was in the mix Everybody stepped cause my pocket wasn't fat My girl got a new man, I fixed his flat I'm the one that they're laughin' at They say, "Cheesy rat, you ain't all that" Chorus: *BizMarkie again* 	Can you feel it? 	Can you feel it? 	Can you feel it? 	Can you feel it? 	Nothin can save ya Verse Two: I mean crabbin, played out by backstabbin; I feel like tiein a anchor to my ankle and jumpin right in the ocean Cause I'm ashy and I can't afford lotion So-called friends in the jewelry store Told me, "Todd, come back when you get off tour" Souped as hell, I really regret it Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit How can a man like me be walkin around in a world of misery? And if women like a man with a body, it's not mine Cause they be walkin past me like I'm a stop sign My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty Sayin, "Todd, as if he used to have a sporty" The Benz was slammin, the Jeep was pumpin Ain't that somethin? I just laugh, this isn't what I was raised for When I walk away, it's like ain't this a kick in the rear, that I'm standin here And can't afford a tissue for my tear Should I drink wine and brandy or get a job puttin stripes on candy Or put a hole in donuts? Cause when you're broke, your middle name is "so-what?" I had to learn in an incredibly fast way When you ain't got no money they treat you like an ashtray I pawned all my jewelry and clothes Right after that, I got dissed by all the hoes that I thought was mine, but really never was Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz That my tank was on "E", and that means empty That Twinkie looks good, so mister don't tempt me Everybody thought I was trippin I rode the back of the bus, but my grip kept on slippin I'm the man that they're laughin at They say, "Cheesy rat, you ain't all that" Repeat chorus Verse Three: I wanna hang with my man like, "Let's do this" But this man like "Who this?" That's right, the brother got two faces They got me puttin the tips on shoelaces P on the Puma, a mop and a bucket My motto is... I don't care I don't give a damn, so what, why try? I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money It's so funny Cars ride by with the boomin system Sayin, "Leave him alone, my man already dissed him" Now I'm on the cheeseline, poverty-stricken As the red tape thickens I go to the park, they wanna baseball-bat me I go to the mall, they throw my old tapes at me I'm so horny And every girl I know be like, "He's so corny" I want money in a hurry I'm gettin tired of leftover curry I wanna fall off, but I don't know where the edge is I'm so hungry, I eat my neighbor's hedges Now I realize I gotta go for mine It's windshield time I take quarters, pennies, dimes and nickles and a kiddy's tricycle I'm a desperado "I'ma steal your rims" is my motto I watch wrestlin until I'm dizzy sore So if you're cashin your rent check, know how to get busy Go to the drive-through, run with a milkshake Go to the supermarket, pocket a raw steak I need beer I'ma catch the Miller truck out there You know how they throw, the newspapers in the morning The owner don't want em I'm the man that they're laughin at They say, "Cheesy rat, you ain't all that." Repeat chorus Outro: So yo, one more time, one more time Party people in the house tonight Just throw your hands in the air And wave em like you just don't care Keep em there Run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LL Cool J Album: Mama Said Knock You Out Song: Farmers Blvd. (Our Anthem) Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch (Hey man, don't you realize In order for us to make this thing work, man  We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Future of the funk. Records I recorded minus all the junk. People spread gossip and believe what they must,  but I slam dunk punks and make 'me bite the dust. A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed, and put 'em in a bucket like he's chicken feed. Check out the...pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice (nice-nice); and I'm-a dust you off and dust you off twice. I heard it's all observant, hysterical fan- -natics of the Asiatic miracle man. Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real. Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel. He's so-so, I got the instinct.  They call me Deputy Dog to put your booty in the clink. You're dancin' to a Marley Marl remix single, love: Let me see your earrings jingle, love...   Chorus {4x} I chopped you, chewed you, baked you, and schooled you.

Chorus {4x} When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think, cuz you grabbed the microphone like your booty don't stink. And tried to run down that, I can't get over that garbage you were sayin': you call that a battle rap? How you gonna go against an army with a handgun? I'm L.L., and you don't understand, son. I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'. Now you look booty like that bum Miss Givins. Whoever geesed you up...nah, how should I say it? Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it. Cuz man, YO, I feel for ya brother, I'm a baaaaaad... (Word to the mother!) Takin' out sucker while the ladies pucker, and rollin' over punks like a redneck trucker.

You can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice, but when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice. Serve to curbs, I never swerve a superb. Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves. Played your hand, lost track of your plan, when I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man. Play you like a poker chip, that's what you get. I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met the Titan of Fightin', excitin' when writin', you're trite from the toy, boy, I gotta enlight, so start bitin'. You know you can't create and get mean like this; when I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH! When it's all over, said and done, my friend, they'll say, "L.L. Cool J just scored again." So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop. Here's your token back, you're gettin' off at the next stop. I'm-a deliver and give a speech with vigor. Pass the wine cooler you big black....

Here to pump punks with real hot lead chunks. Full-grown I ain't no baby with these rhymes kid. Put the mic down my peoples know where ya live. I chop you little brittle riddle right up the middle and have the police playin the fiddle in the hospital. Somebody said, "He couldn't rip with the roughness." Rhymes kick your teeth but end up frontless. Soul survivor of a thousand beats sendin funeral wreathes to all ya use-to-be chiefs. Is a raw to a bearlin in the woods (?).

Because I hit ya with the funk of the fly-talker and make your girl "Bump-bump! Get it, Get it!" like Luke Skywalker. I can't front I love rappin with a passion. Crash your head front into the funk you think I'm slam dancin. See when you front you make mad the alter weight (?). Freak this: "funky twin powers activate!" Sheik on the mic with the cape and muscles. Crushin MC's while their girls do the hustle. See other rappers try to dis the lords but yo, your dead wrong. Damnit, can't we all just get along? We'll see there simply ain't no frontin allowed. Yo, I'm out like the Cosby show peace to the Funky Child. Punchin your god-damn eyebrows off roughin it up north lookin' like your laugh off (?). It's a blash smash and crash from my stash. Be watchin your back kid. Your girl and the phat path. Talkin bout your macks and tax. What's with that? Your gettin wet like sloooow sex. Rippin on that old school kid. Leavin sliced as a slit says I wet your crib. No question. Testin the west and the east and once the ammo was released and I'll make your girl come and getcha. Hope you get the picture. Boy your better off if a pit bit ya! What's its like in the illest fight. Believe the hype. I'm givin crowds more nose jobs than Mike. Fight sight alright they bite spot light tonight is hype trigger happy tripe don't hit bite  my owner's right. And ya know it's comin off so don't ask it. Snatchin the vocal and hotties on the rap tip. Mackin ya boys up. Bringin the noise up. And now ya need stitches because my voice cuts. Chainsaw gain more and riegn raw. And never let a brother play it is my main law.

Deliverance but yet some don't understand. Rough on a late night thrill after midnight kill or be killed. Soldiers, warriors  (?) at each other  on the combat zone. Supreme power on the throne. Lighting strikes in every home. Terrified men run down the street. So many dead bodies  it's hard to eat. Come, we gotta rise above the wall. To see what no man has seen before. Blindin' light that got you through the night. God is on your side to got in a fight. [REFRAIN] Homicide suicide death. BOOM! Ain't nobody left. Ohhhh! It's startin to take affect. Your on your knees you scared to death. Tornados with a thousand people spinnin. One fight at the cross and now god is winin. The whole Earth cracks in half. The sea turns red from the blood bath. Abandoned buildings burned and two remain (?). Terrified  you feel the fire blaze. The ground can't hold your weight. You reach out to grab the pearly gates. Who clocked this f*** not from space. Never again will you see the human race. 19 angels leadin the devil straight to hell! Torment! Pain! What you're seein here  you can't explain. All your life some men  we played the game. Never realize that there's a flame.

Dear hip-hop, I apologize for how you've been treated I should've fought for my culture, instead I retreated The game is wounded, I stood and watched while they beat it My culture starved, I refused to feed it They sold you for a dollar like slaves in iron collars A*R's chase you with bloodhounds and rottweilers You went to the highest bidder, you was pissed on like kitty litter But far from a quitter, but there's somethin to consider Nah, after much deliberation I decided I'm the hottest cat to ever receive rotation I'm the foundation, one of the chief architects of this dream we're all chasin, I had to speak up Too much time was wastin WHOA~! So here we go I'm tired of the money talk and the, bitches and hoes Everybody's always, soundin the same I have to walk on water I can't, drown in the game [Chorus 2X: scratched samples] "Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark" {*3X*} "They used to do it out in the park" [LL Cool J] I remember your bar mitzvah, that burgundy label Me and Jam Master had the battle of the big cables Before the Serratos, real vinyls, real tables Skills was the motto, no hype, no fables You seemed so happy, you loved me so much You popped off and went platinum, at my slightest touch Oversized hoodies, Yukon trucks 20 years later, it's like lightning struck They're worshipin the money, they're prayin to the bank They danced on slaveship, slept as it sank The devil made 'em do it, but only God do I thank Because we aren't done yet, there's still gas in the tank You look in a man's eyes, that's how you really tell his rank Not the size of his account, check him, he might bounce It's all on the line, this time it really counts I'll bleed for this one, on down to the last ounce [LL Cool J] They rent a crib they're frontin, they rent a car they're stuntin They rent a chain they're bluffin, that's why the culture's sufferin And even if you're a millionaire that don't mean nothin unless you build your community and encourage some unity Too much ego... too much posin If he's so hot then, why's the culture frozen? It's time for a change, the order needs to be rearranged And this song was pre-ordained After 2 long decades, LL still remains And you can blame it on my spirit, not on my brains Time to put on my armor, go to war for the game Cause it's on its last leg, and that's more than a shame This is a lifestyle homey, it's more than champagne But I will make a toast to Flash reachin the Hall of Fame I end it with a line, from the book of King James Let there be light when I write graffiti on the train [LL Cool J - repeat 2X] Let us proclaim the mystery and fame I pray the Lord my culture be saved If hip-hop dies before I awake May Jam Master Jay cut a LL break The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LL Cool J Album: Authentic Song: Bath Salt Typed by: AZ Lyrics [Intro] I think this intro should be more dramatic Ah man It's LL season, let's ride!

Put that mic down, admire the technique and tight tight sounds of a +Renagade+, never been afraid, the time is right now Before I take my bow and finally allow my love affair with rap to fade, I'll sink into the page Pleasur and the pain that came from rulin the game And the half Dominican that gave me brains in the fast lane A seventeen-year reign, simple and plain When I ruled the rap game and all my peers sold cocaine One-three-two Uptown, when Rich Porter told me "See you can push a new car, it's different for a rap star" And AZ was givin 50s to the homeless They never bragged about it – "L, we don't condone this" On the back of the bike with Alpo Doin a buck down one-two-five, hopin to stay alive Favorite spot rooftop Me and Big chuckle up when he was hittin up "Juicy" and whatnot Damn, when Dapper Dan got shot up Before they made drops when we had to cut the top up Some cats neglected the fact that L was hot Cause they warm and electin me hot when I stepped in the spot Lyrically reppin the block on Farmers to rock But my sex symbol status made me, corny to cop The microphone strategist ripped the apparatus Left competition embarrassed but I never held malice Kinda saw street literature Used to lose battles on purpose so these cats can dream more I wanna see y'all shine without the use of a nine You might see a nigga, I see a black Einstein A diamond in the rough, he's remidin me as tough Young girls takin X, she's blinded by the stuff Oh my God, where did we go wrong? Are you doin what you're doin cause I ruined you with songs? God forgive me, I never knew my power to devour the demons Y'all know the Devil be schemin It's a manifestation of the pain of a nation that makes materialism the only thing we're chasin The real gangstas never talked to me tough Never told me they was hard, or claimed to be my God When I first found the courage to bounce up outta Queens And saw Big Dave comin up out the store with money machines My only dream was to rock mics in the spotlight Joint bumpin on Marley Show all night Whoever thought that I would be a movie star? A rap icon, chokin the game like a python Russell turned the hype on, exploded like a pipe bomb {*explosion*} Just because a young boy, turned the mic on Still admire skills and cats that are ill with lyri-kills, nowadays the chorus is payin the bill The black man found a way outta the hood Now it's slaves to {*edit*} mayor's not all good Don't let 'em take our music and plagiarize the game Then you call up and request it and pretend it's really flames?

I'm proud of where I'm from (If you don't judge my gold chains) But not everything we've done (I'll forget the iron chains) And it ain't like you and me can rewrite history (Can't rewrite history baby) [Brad Paisley] (LL Cool J) Ohhhh, Dixieland (The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin) I hope you understand, what this is all about (Quite frankly, I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin about this lately) I'm a son of the new South  (The past is the past, you feel me?) And I just want to make things right (Let bygones be bygones) Where all that's left is Southern pride [Outro: LL Cool J] R.I.P. Robert E. Lee  but I gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freein me, nah mean? It's real... it's real..
