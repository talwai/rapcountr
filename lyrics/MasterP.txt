thing ya know ya at the hotel rockin' I can't have a bitch cause we didn't have no money you was a trip So you makin' that mail, it's kind of risky You thinkin' fuck she thinkin' rags to the riches So this the shit you gotta beat Meet a freak before ya fall for another man's freal But if ya laugh, ain't a damn thing funny Cause ya like P, life ain't nothin' but bitches and money [Hook] [Verse 2] I'm the K-I-N-G, don't avenge me Don't think cause I'm stingy I want cash, I don't flash Ask my bitch, fuck the dash Rollin' in the street in a fresh ass Rolls Checkin' out the bitches and the funky hoes Ooh who is this behind the tinted glass A bitch named Gina wanna give me some ass Well next week call the honey Cause life ain't nothin' but bitches and money [Hook] [Verse 3] My Vette, clean as shit I see some hoes lookin' they wanna ride in it Bitches think a nigga can tap for some ass Open like a fuckin' convertible runs off of gas So open on up and start pumpin' Cause that don't be workin' hoes get something for nothin' Man life ain't nothin' but bitches and money [Hook] [Verse 4] I love money...and bitches too The ones as sweet as honey But when she fucks up, she's gotta go Don't let her stay but the cash flow I could give a damn about a stupid ho Bitch ya can't make me rich this I know This is behind me I need big dollars and fuckin' thick bitch behind me And I'ma get them to thinkin' hope But I ain't fuckin' with em' if they broke Cause money attracts money And when ya ain't got none all ya days are funny Just like my boys said When ya got a pocket full of money Everything is funny Ain't that the truth Ruth With a pocket full of dough fuck a bitch, hella fun And afterwards she will cease All I care about is bitches and money [Hook] [Verse 5] I think it's all types of games bein' played But to a bitch these days the looks ain't shit Unless these niggas pay Look here bro' ya gotta suffer Cause a motherfucker with trues and Vogues got all the hoes Don't even cuss, she think a nigga is hustle The more ya make the more she take Bring her to dinner think of desert Come up with an empty plate This to them young hoes There's money, meals, and haves This another way ya feel up Mike and Thomas and rock Ruth So don't take it personal hoes just keep runnin' And to the fellas out there, you know how it goes Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money The

white ball Only fifteen, already got fiends And workin' the ghetto like Jack Stalk could work some beans Livin' off a high, gold ones on his ride Bitches on his side, but only livin' to retire Ain't that a shame, took him out the game  Same fool he used to roll with, yelled out his name  Popped in his chest, didn't wear his vest Some day his kid took his first step, he took his last breath Chorus Who's under the white sheet Somebody bring the yellow tape  The ghetto took him under, today will be a sad day Ain't no time to cry, no time to shed no tears You know the way he died, the same way he lived Who was his killer, found him dead on his knees Same room with his wife, and his kid left to grieve Hopin' that this is a nightmare, one pop and he's outta there  God rest his soul, left his kid in a wheelchair Scared for his life, his daddy took the ghetto flight  And at the funeral, momma said boy you know it's gonna be alright But know he's gone, ain't nobody to run his home Another kingpin, stripped from the ghetto throne Lost at the game of life, ain't no time to think twice The same fool he trusted, and I sleeps with his wife Tagged his toe, strapped him in the ziplock  Another another flip-flopped, pop was slangin' that crack rock Now he's gone, Amazing Grace his last song Six ballers carried him out the church, took take his his home 4 limos, 3 Cutlass, 2 El Doggs, a cop and the hearse  Everybody had they lights on And when the straps pops to lower him down in the grave See it was sad the way his his family misbehaved His family cryin', but everybody gots to die But you won't feel what they feel 'Till somebody in your family dies Chorus The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Master P Album: Ice Cream Man Song: Mr. Ice

[Yes I Am!!!!] 1st Verse: [Master P -- Fiend] Master P: Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin' captain? All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, No Limit niggas don't say hoes, ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... Fiend: Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. Captain Smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. On top of that, the bitch fat!!! Makin' a career off this nigga, and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this nigga, go figga, all she wanted was that man to change, but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains.

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her shit. I bought her lunch the first time,  but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, I hit it one time and they be callin' back, talkin' bout' "Silkk, why you do all that playin'?". And she had the nerve to tell me, if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick,  then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, a bitch might give you a buck, man, but since you my boy you  better use a condom, before you try to fuck. Take the game from this show bug,  cuz Silkk ain't no love. I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I take'em back and get the most love. And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work.

working with no leverage or incentive g 'Cause their nothing you ever give to me On television or them history books Got black kids thinking they only out on this earth to be crooks See all these

your fame, reputation and your name But baby we can do it take your time do it right You don't wanna be a superstar overnight Trying to live that ghetto life Chorus (4x): Pimp C: I live my life for my son so he can have something Blessed just to see a new day so I'm trying to grab something I been on top of the world and at the bottom too When you up you got lots of friends and when you down it's few The way we grew up was wrong, I'm the first to admit I know God and just drop me here to be going through this I lost D-Ray last year and it's just not the same Just at the time in his life when he was trying to change He told me, Pimp I need help, I want up out the game I made a promise, I lied cause the next night he died I guess our childhood is over 'cause man ain't nothing funny And everythign that I love revolve around sex and money I wanna have some more kids but in the 90's that's crazy The woman's polluted so it ain't safe to make babies And it's a shame cause Uncle Sam ain't
