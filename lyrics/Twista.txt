aim it up If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up For the ones who never gave it up,  Take a champagne glass and raise it up  Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood spilling Poppin' lip and taking over his tip is why he had to kill him Now his bodies in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost  Somebody tricked off and the killer was caught So now his lifes his cost  You might get caught So to make a move these motherfuckers is petrified  All the best that tried won't even slide  So just bless the rest that died Is it a test of pride when inside You grip a trigger but you didn't wanna pull it  Could it be a motherfucker that you notice  On the other side of the bullet  Should it matter now you figure fuck it I'ma waste him  It's just a murda for the nation  But some end up locked up, broke up For felonies and over overly motherly abrasion  Now in front of me encased in a coffin is a body  With people around sad and froze  Teardrops and rain  But folks didn't really feel the pain until the casket closed  I was drastic chose and the mother threw a frown  Even though the gunner was found  Cause it seems like yesterday when he was running around  Now he under the ground cause they gonna get down in these streets Even  though you pack a piece for heat these niggaz urgin' to bust  The game ain't the same so stay away from the curb  If you out there serving em' up and  hook (repeat)  w/ "make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt" Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood pouring  Tragedy mess a man look in the mirror then I see the stud mourning  As these streets erases others it encase a brother  You had enough heart to waste this brother  But could you face his mother I was faced with other  Type of problems that had held me back  Couldn't tell me jack now I'm gone in my own zone  You ain't gotta tell me that so me trail me back to a time  When a motherfucker 'd lost his will survive  Me and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal  Eat or had to kill to survive  I remember when you had my back  When the relative passed and my momma cried  When the house caught flames  You collapsed in my arms when you heard that father d' died  I take drama in stride Even though I had to go through a thing to get myself together  Still suffer but the worst is gone  So it's on till' the roamin' man have his shelter  But if I end up back on the streets again and I had to recieve my fate Smoke  weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes  To keep the kids straight  Cause you did straight if your seed proceed  As long as they keep learning and keep growing up  Right now we survive in a place that's full of doubt  And about to self-destruct  hook x2  Visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize  Critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land  Where the unforgettable dies  Subliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it  If he don't peep it and keep it in check soon  Womb to the tomb death is in the next room  If a nigga ain't realizin' a k's and tech's doom  Let's assume another brother wanna laugh at you  I think he just took a blast at you  You won't have it you killed him  There go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you Telling  you a stranger must be crazy  To step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous  Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle  If we have two things of bust  It's cocaine to us and my brains to dust I represent you up there so I try  Long as I leave my enemy bust vacinity crushed  I don't really give a fuck if I die  So why lie my people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost It's a  plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying  With their grandmother's hand on the cross  So I take a stand when I talk ran instead of walked  To chalk another victory  How you did the caper hid the paper  Breaking other niggas off is a mystery  With the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs  Just keep comin' up better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets In a  ghetto of a world that's corrupt  hook The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back

Your mind I don't mean to make a disaster of like when daddy mastered love But if a bogus brother breakin you for every penny you earn then how could you still show the bastard love? I guess I'm with a cold clique Thought you was gon' be spendin me? I bet you think you sho' did But game recognize game now you lame in the brain stupid trick That's what you get for tryin to gold-dig Now let me play with your emotions slow Chorus [Twista] Whassup girl? It's the Twista and the Verbal Tantrum once again with a sack big enough for me and a friend You do know how to roll B's don't you? Well let's fill one up with a dub and a little bit of love  And take it to the head for some of this long-lastin blunt passion [Twista] I know you think it's blasphemy but won't you show my boys and pass for me, after he past the B? Since you said I was your majesty, I had to see and when you get paid then push some cash to me  Is it a tragedy, that I can get her so gone that she be trippin talkin up "I love a lot" But the only love I got, is when I grip a mic or when I hug the glock or when I rub the twat I'm pickin up a dub in spots, skip the studs in the clubs and the phony perpetrators with jobs  The Speedknot, Psycho Drama shocked the world Triple Dark, there's a Conflict, be pimpin 'em with gators n darts Collectin papers n gobs Playa haters remarks'll get smoked to a blunt dust So keep walkin and next time you hear grown folks talkin other people better shut the (fuck) up Cause I make the women suck up You insist to be trippin when we be gamin like Don Juan Without the filet mignon and Grey Poupon The thieves just ain't the charm because I made the bomb? Now I don't mean no harm; but either come on in or get on gone Now watch me live a kosher flow In between your thighs come take a pull and divide  but let your tongue go coastin low Now let me play with your emotions slow  Chorus The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Twista & The Speedknot Mobstaz f/ Newsense Album: Mobstability Song: Crook County (B.O.N.E.

Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit You know what I'm sayin', you can just ball for free Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration And gotta face incarceration Eh yo, Liffy Stokes, let 'em know what's happenin' [Liffy Stokes] A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones My mom didn't understand me "Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy from two to the head, dumped in the riverbed I didn't to hurt you so badly," I was young and dumb Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow But now regret what I've done Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang I had to do my thang When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain All the shit's the same My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets To get you out your seat Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet And let 'em feel something deep Deep so the realest can feel How I felt right before I bust that steel Rappin 'bout my life of skrill And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill [Chorus 2x] Come on and take a little trip with a legit balla Chi shot-callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang) Tigers all up in the wall (Some bitches in the back and a pocket full of scratch   take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away) [Mayz] This shit I've been tokin' is potent Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened Countercode with the scope in close range I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain But now I did finally flip my shit legit And workin' a different angle of the game Even though my hussle ain't changed I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain Singin' tapes of cain The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot On the paper you done gain until you drain But I put that on the foe I'ma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets With my mobsta elites on the way to North Riverside Mall Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at Keepin' shit tight for y'all [Chorus 2x] [Twista] On the bus in disgust will I able to throw rocks in my pocket Nickel sacks in the other For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother Straight up hustler What's the mental frame of mind That nigga had to have the roll Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets Or with the pistol playin' for you Mr. Reaper Forgive those, I explode like c-4 so give me 50 feet Bustin' shots in every directions  a nigga stop a moment from getting made I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, GD's or foes Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a ball Now I fin to spend stacks at the mall Bend the blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller Twista AKA "The Bitch Caller", bring your money to the mob Just to be a pimp-shit talker [Chorus 2x] [Twista] If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm It it's on, then I gotta ride out with the mobstas,

to gettin' paid Cheddar in a bundle, fifties and hundreds and G stacks If I could just hit that big lick I could relax And ease back off of thuggin' and stick to hustlin' Concentrate on paper and let the shorties do the bustin' While I motivate on power moves, you live be coward rules Singing the blues while I pack shit that'll knock you out your shoes 'Cause I'm a fool playing the game of the streets Claiming elites, making sure my family eats We roll and it flees, bunkin' niggas out of their seats While mobbin' on beats, soon niggas can't back down or retreat Preventing mine, just doing petty crimes, I'm not petty or nice Standin' in line, calmly waitin' on my time to shine 'Cause when I shine, I'ma glisten As all the heads come up missing I'ma slide in and assume the position My

did it But if Trax didn't do it I can't fuck it 'Cause it's a family thang You know Chi-Town's the motherland of the wild The chain of mobsters and gangs But we're the elite few that just can't be contained Tippin' only the plane, determine it's about the game Like a playa stays the same, ain't tryin' to act strange to change 'Cause the more paper you got, the more you got to slang And there's more haters to bang 'cause they all want a piece You got to be slick as grease 'cause they want the playas deceased Restin' in peace But my motto's simply too tight for you to threaten my life With a knife, gun or mic You don't really wanna fight so just swallow your pride Before I come inside your crib and kidnap the shorty and bride Every nigga alive wish he had a psycho status Will your punks ready to ride so the bitches can come at us In the city of thugs, police, politicians and drugs If they ain't passin' the bubble, niggas carry a grudge, but no love So I don't give a muthafuck if you killin' me I'm pissin' out headshots, protestin' my mobstability [Twista] If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right So I circle the block strapped Watching the workers while they circle muthafuckas at night They work to tippin' me 'cause dope fiends ain't wangers These wanches are skanches, this ain't just how the cracks and hiatus My crew react tamers than sweat hogs, to protect that (?) bomb But no teflon, your flesh was tearin', for the love of this heron I bare arms and I'm quick to snatch cards to those who react hard Don't judge these, got you robbed, I'ma get more cheddar for my

 Zip polos holding pistolos and mobstas know those Sooner then booted, looted then zooted, (?) shoes so can I Automatics but semi, then I, watches your midnight 'Cause I be handlin' my function when the nine-milliter get to jumpin' Dumpin' on niggas who claimin' my muthafuckas ain't worth for nothin' I'm bustin', how's game I peep when I was a shorty Having big dreams on money, cars and bitches

I'ma start squeezin these Them niggas ain't G's, they wanna be thugs And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here I done dropped more dead bodies than tears Brought to life momma's worst fears Pictures of a son dyin from that hot ones flyin Baby mama's cryin at the funeral Cause the magnum lit him like a Black & Mild When I rolled out on his ass on the solo I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co I got to tip on the low-low  Bust it there like po-po takin lives with the, oh no It's a 4-4, mini-missle with a silencer for the whistle My favorite pistol, cause when I let that bitch ride I know the homicide is being carried out in official  Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none Because of these hot ones that explode on contact A manic that's prepared to die in combat Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say I can see the fear in your face  as I reach my waist for this warm embrace I got plenty love for the 4-4 But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace I got plenty love for the 4-5 But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace I got plenty love for the nine-mill And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace All you muthafuckas better duck and hide Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace [Mayz] I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives With my customized 4-5 Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys You muthafuckas better get wise Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin to kill the elite Cause you ain't gettin no more tries Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it Long as I don't hear the hoe cry Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five Make sure the nigga crossed through dies You don't wanna throw them thangs Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time But Mayz ain't new to the game I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin Punk pretend to be your friend til they get close enough to your ends To do you in, that shit puts me on ten And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin big shit about war Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win But I dare one of you niggas to say my name Cause I put a fuckin bullet into your closest kin Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace [Twista] With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go Miss Millimeter's makin a mockery of motherfuckers gotsta be ruckus When I get my clutches upon this hoe Itchin' to let the barrel blow Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow, geronimo Spit 'em up and swallow slow I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back Payback from flashback, some bitches know Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list Deposition die for servin' them six Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick 'Cause I be working my bitch Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess Loose revolver used to be a problem solver But the nina made me a baller No strap could take the place of the black nine Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste From my warm embrace I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4 Warm embrace I got plenty love for the 4-5

For Me Typed by: flavaflow@hotmail.com * * send corrections to the typist (Todd Nitty) Here's the tale of a young black male raised in these city streets out here hustling to make ends meet In a world thats so corrupt thats ran by greed money and the power for me I'm a survivor I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that So before you cash your stones down on me I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror And ask somebody to pray for you Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla In the city of Chi the home of the G's If ya dont work ya dont eat that's been the code of the streets As for me I was brought up at an early age learned how to cook cane started to gang bang and its a damn shame I chose game but see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame and I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights and be wondering which nigga wanna take my life until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters (chorus) I'm living the street life and I just cant get away I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day so everynight I pray oh I pray I'm living the street life and I just cant get away I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day so everynight I pray well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends my whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam man I dont know whats in store for me god will I reach 21 why is life so damn hard see thats the question thats asked and is there a heaven or hell can the young black live or will he be chained in the cell I don't know as for me I only trusted a few I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do they say theres chances for everybody thats bullshit that little girl had no chance when that bullet hit I mean it blew to the sky and all you heard was a cry oh lord don't let my baby die (chorus) Til the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would Ain't shit changed like oh once said And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead neither is Pook or Kansas City true og's still here with me my homie boo, boo what up and you know I cant forget about my nigga nigga Novesnake nightime boats and herbie Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me I rock genue death so dam sensless big houses what the fucking radio been

Better yet all an illusion Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away I don't wanna conceive takin his either Dipped into the back and took a breather Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man Or is it trying to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin There's dreams to fulfill still Can't complete em with a still kill Face to face with enemies still grill Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed even though I'm not hopin to go I wish someone would open the do' This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow Is this the end? [Chorus Two: Ginuwine] Just, can't, let, go (Is this the end?) I, just, don't, know Wish it would've happened then [Verse Two: Puff Daddy, Twista] Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver Hit the alley saw his man in a landcruiser In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger Heard shots from a steel bruiser Teflon in the seat took a pale stress Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest What's wrong with the brakes in the LX? Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole A car came to the rescue I bailed in and said, "Bless you But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?" I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly (But who are you?) The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on No protection from one time, only caught for my prime So I asked the Father what I did so wrong? Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper Prepare my mind for the capture Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture? Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch Cause he's coldblooded and merciless Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us Then for survival we both to bust But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder Don't wanna die til I get older Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable so now my sight is gettin dark a lot Let's step off up in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot And try to wait until his ma get hot I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin You never know when it's your time to leave Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car but wait, I can't find the keys Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close Is it one of them unholy men? With a strap ready to boldly sin Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when Is this the end?
