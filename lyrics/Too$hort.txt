from the city of dope It couldn't be saved by John the Pope Coz the base head lyric sees the light Two fat raps to the head last night Cocaine Cocaine, is that your rap Every day and night its coming back C-O-C-A-I-N-E The rich man's high what it used to be But things looking different in eighty-five Cocaine, cocaine is that your high Since age thirteen what have I seen A lotto of base heads straight coke fiends Snorting, puffing, that's the life But it's all over when you hit that pipe Big coke dealers on the knock All smoked up with no more rocks Base heads buy, coke from him But he smokes more than all of them The big coke man, ain't too cool He smokes more than all you fools He's gotta a lotta do, but not a lotta bank A brand new car with an empty tank Pretty white smoke all in his chest And a 84 Benz, reposessed Girl, that's your life Girl smoking that glass pipe Fresh young tender only fifteen Walking on a strip just wanna be seen Never touch coke a day in her life But now that girl's gotta have her pipe Coz she met a man his name was jock Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock Put it in her joint all crunched up And now everyday she takes a puff Girl, that's your life Girl smoking that glass pipe  I know you know what coke can do Come into your life and take over you Now you kicking back thinking bout your dream But it never comes true coz you're just a coke fiend You asked your woman what's the prob She said its you coz you don't do your job Used to make good love from the start But now coke had done damage to your private parts Girl, that's your life Girl smoking that glass pipe  Your mind is gone your brain is blazed You've been wide awake for the last three days Inhale, exhale you don't care coke smoke only no fresh air You can't even talk you don't wanna listen You and your body on that cocaine mission Three days straight where's your mind It's gonna out of town and your brain is fried Just smoke and choke until you're broke Just smoke that coke until you croke And it would be, I can't lie No great loss if you should die Coz your life is wrecked, you girl is checked She chose on my and I was set I took her home to make my move But she wanted to base she was just like you The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Too $hort Album: Don't Stop Rappin' Song: Female Funk Typed by:

everything you can for life Too bad you don't know what I think you should Too much of a good thing ain't so good Your nothing but a player, whatever you feel You can't be loved cause your not real But tricks in the city could solve right there Players always can't be players -Digital Voice- Do you wanna be a player Players Always can't be players Mother Fucker Do you wanna be a player Players

I come from the Oakland town Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down Young brothers my age making dollars so long Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone See him draped in gold, we call him Big Bank Bob Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job Call him trash, he supplies for the dopefiend's tweak But what you make in a year he might make in a week Cold cash money is the answer to life Feedin fat hovers to a dopefiend's pipe Gotta keep rollin, just can't stop Only two worries are a thief or the cops People keep sayin: it's all so wrong But the rocks roll strong all night long Another Park Street life, the age old story And now the coke dealers take all the glory They're the ones you meet big time on the street I say the coke dealers are now the elite See, the average dopehouse will take your soul Trade it for a rock and do the same with your gold But if you think about it really it all sounds silly Smoked out Willie in his washed off Philly Open up shop down the block And everybody's tryin to get a piece of that rock Coke dealers Big time, baby Smokin Coke [ VERSE 2 ] Cocaine the demon, it knows you well Sellin you a trip to a place called hell You never even thought you'd get hooked Starin in the mirror, scared to look You think about life and think it's cold Like drivin with a ???? down a rocky road Now the rock man is your best friend The only one you talk to time and again You even tried dealin, but that's no fun Before you made a sale it was in your lungs So the coke dealer now lives on your life Like a four year marriage you're the man's wife You can hate it with a passion, but you won't fuss He's the driver of a Caddy and you're ridin the bus You think it's not fair, I tell you it is Cause he bought yours and you bought his Bought his cars, his clothes, and he bought the coke Now he looks good and you look smoked It doesn't take much to realize All you gotta do is just open your eyes You're cold bein pimped by a rock in some glass What's it gonna take before you fall on your ass? Bankrupt, smoked out, just simply through Cold street walkin with a hole in your shoe Coke dealers Big time, baby Smokin Cokeland [ VERSE 3 ] I once had a homeboy rollin strong Sold coke all day and all night long He made a lotta money and bought a lotta stuff But soon he went broke and it didn't take much First he started smokin, and all that he figured Was the more he sold dope, you see his bank got bigger But my homie thought wrong cause he could be stopped The vice squad rolled and the boy got popped He was out on bail before he made it to jail Wasn't about to do time when he's doin so well Say he had a lotta money and some real good friends But he was almost broke when he flipped again So he got on his grind, he wasn't wastin a day Opened up shop and started pumpin the weight He thought about the boys that he could not pay So he hustled by himself thinkin that's okay But one night he was chillin with a freak named Carol His door was kicked in and he was starin at a barrel The brother with the gun saw him tweak on the base Walked right up and put the Uzi in his face He said, "Give up the dope if you still wanna breathe I tell you one time, you better listen to me" As my homie got robbed he lost the fight And now he's just a smoker probably totin tonight Coke dealers Yeah, I'm big time, baby Smokin COKE!

Chorus So just peep the game and don't call it crap Cause to me, life is one hard rap Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed 600 million on a footbal team And her baby dies just like a dope fiend The story I tell is so incomplete Five kids in the house and no food to eat Don't look at me and don't ask me why Mama's next door getting high Even though she's got five mouths to feed She's rather spend her money on a H-I-T I always tell the truth about things like this I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list Instead of adding to the task force send some help Waiting on him I'd better help myself Housing Authority and the O.P.D. All these guns just to handle me in the... Chorus Even though they put us down and call us animals We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes Drive fancy cars, make love to stars Never really saying just who we are We use alias names like TOO $HORT Sell you stuff you might kill for Young kids grow up and that's all they know Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin dope Only thing he knows is how to survive But will he kill another brother before he dies? In the ghetto, you keep one eye open All day long, just hoping and hoping You can pay your bills and not drink too much Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up Like me, but you don't see Ten years from now, where will you be? Chorus So much game in a Too $hort rap Blacks can't be white and whites can't be black Why you wanna act like someone else? All you gotta do is just be yourself We're all the same color underneath Short Dog's in the house you'd better listen to me Never be ashamed of what you are Proud to be black stand tall at heart Even though some people give you no respect Be intelligent, when you put em in check Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say So if you don't listen it's not my fault I'll be getting paid while you'll be paying the cost Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth While me and my peoples try to get out Chorus The Original Hip-Hop (Rap)

funky I make the beats for me and my homies Newspaper reporters and others always ask me Why I'm X-rated and I rap so nasty When I was a teen I did nothing else But pick up a pen and express myself The things I wrote were obsene and kind of dirty But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me She also said that it would set me free I guess she was R-I-G-H-T on the nail Cause now I'm out making my mail It all started out from a freaky tale If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it Short Dog ain't changing, so forget it You can sell out if you want to, homie But I'm a stay short but funky Verse 2: Don't stop, just call it verse two It's Short Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro I might say something that your mother don't like so Don't play it loud if she's around to see But you can play this cause it's rated PG When I'm rated X I'm just having my fun I bring a smile to each and every one But there's a serious side in everything I say Life is too short for you to wait 'til the next day Just straighten up your life and you can start right here Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer People always say it ain't right to preach But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky So you can live like a king homie And I'm a stay short but funky Verse 3: You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends See I don't trip on a punk cause I jack him Too $hort plus the cuss words equals platinum What would I look like dancing on a stage I wave my hand and do it like the old days But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand With 50 million dancers and a big old band That ain't me, I'm from the old school Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool Cause I'm an Oaktown mack and it's like that, so It all comes out in my records and my stage show In my category

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Too Short Album: Short Dog's in the House Song: Pimpology Typed by: ggwayfer@ucdavis.edu (Pimp): All we want is the money (Pimp 2): I keep em' bro. Wake up one morning, and, with some money to 	 spend, they go crazy. (Verse 1): I'm going to tell you a story in stereo, About the pimping game, that you should know. But if you don't, it's alright. Cause I'll be spittin' this game to you all damn night. When I was 3 years old,  Straight pimp game I was told. My daddy sent me to pimp school. In this man's world, you can't be no fool. If a pimp is what you wanna be,  You're gonna have to learn pimpology. Pimpology: a pimp's profession. Can't be effected by the Great Depression. So if you want to be giant sized, Come to my school. Get pimp-matized. In your school, what do they teach? English, math, and history. Pimpin' game, you can learn. And if you do, you will earn A pimp diploma, just for you For learning what you're taught when you come to school. Lesson 1, you should know: Never fall in love, with your ho. Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing: Act cool. Lesson 3: Don't be a trick. If she's poor, if she's rich, If your game is soft or hard, It shouldn't take long to break the broad. Lesson 4: Keep ya ho. It's the most important thing to know. 'Cause I pimp or die. I'm like the Mack: riding around Oakland in a Cadillac. But on the other hand, if you can't pimp And the hos keep treating you like a simp, I don't know what to say about you boys. You better go to the store and buy some toys. 'Cause you can't play this game. (Pimp Talking):  Next time you hear grown folks talking, shut the fuck up y' hear? (Verse 2): Now you heard my story in stereo: About the pimpin' game, that you should know. And if you don't, it's alright, 'Cause I'll be spittin' this game to ya all damn night. I'm Short Dog. Ain't nothing nice. I never rap fake when I'm on the mic. I ride around town in a clean Benz. Never ever frontin' on my real cool friends. My zodiac sign is a Taurus the bull. I drink Old English, and I do get full. If you're wondering why I don't stop my rap,  'Cause other MC's can't rock like that. My music flows like domino's. I pimp these hoes that's how it goes. Tenders on my beeper all day and night. I'm a true blue player homeboy. That's right. O-A-K-L-A-N-D: That's where I rain, top dog MC. Too Short, baby, on the microphone. I work more tails. I don't take freaks home. Man, they start trippin' when they think your rich. Met her yesterday. All on my tip. It's not hard to believe. But that's how it goes. I'm burning rubber on these hoes like vogues. Check out my style. Baby don't stop. If you can't call me Short, just call me Dog. Black is my color. I have no other. Nothing else will do. I've got a black car, black bed, black TV.  I've even got a silk black suit. Dangerous music, and the Dangerous Crew, Oakland, Ca, and the Playboy too. West coast rapping al over the place. Too Short, baby, all in your face. I rap so hardyou can't stop me. My last album sold a million copies. Me and the maestro, laying the beat. DJ scratches from my homeboy Pete. Dangerous music is what you hear. A new LP, every year. You know we rolling. Can't be faking. We come through, and all your girls, we're taking. You know we're rolling. Don't do no simpin'. Oaktown players, strictly pimpin', baby. My name is Short. Just what you've been looking for. Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase. Up in the hills, trying to find my place. Getting lost, getting tossed, getting found and clowned. Every time you see Short baby, you get down. 'Cause the raps I make are the raps you like. The way Sir Too Short rocks the mic. It's a one of a kind, rapping style. Have the freaks in the crowd, going wild. For when I spit my rhyme, I just don't quit. Grab the microphone, and just make me rich. (Pimp 1): It was $35, 000.  (Pimp 2): $35,000 cash money? (Pimp 1): No. I get 1. $35, 000 plus 1, right? (Pimp 2): The one I gave you? (Pimp 1): No, I gave you 6 alright. I had 1. Now $35,000 plus 6 right.   Now $35, 000 plus 1, plus 6 makes 7.   $35, 000 plus 7, right. Motha fucka, can you buy that?

She said "Janet" I said "Oh" Met the bitch last week at my show I told her "Call me" and I gave her my card She talked dirty and my dick got hard That night I fucked the bitch three times straight Next night we made another date I gave a concert and she came backstage Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid But that puusy squeezed tighter than a vice grip Fucked around and met this other bitch Right out the back I told her "Bitch let's go" Took the bitch to my limo even though Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh She told her friend they fuck the best Rushed the bitch to the back seat She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it The limo door opened, it was Janet She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit I kicked back and let 'em have this dick I told the driver "Take me straight home" Then called my partner on the car phone I said "I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch" Come to my house and don't even trip He came over and we served the hoes Fucked the bitches like gigalos Paula and Janet will make you wet in your pants But to me, they're just two more tramps With some good ass motherfucking pussy, no shit Short Dog's in the motherfucking house and I ain't even tripping, bitch The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Too $hort Album: Short Dog's in the House Song: Rap Like Me Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com  Too $hort, MC Rap like me, you'll go straight to the top Keep doing what you're doing and you're sure to get dropped Like a trick, nothing's even up my sleeve A million albums sold and it's hard to believe Well it's true homeboy, it's not a lie I used to sell tapes on Sunnyside I used to catch the 40 bus around the way Me and Fred Benz, slanging tapes All these things, that we did Grab the microphone and start screaming "Bitch!"

they at, where they at, where they at I sold tapes every day me and Freddy B Been famous since 1983 Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed A rap all about you called the special request Oakland, you know I go way back To coug nuts, fal stangs, and cadillac's When homeboys put vogues on any car With 6 by 9's smoking burners Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat Whole town fucked around and started smoking D Every rap I ever made was about this town I made 7 whole albums with no James Brown And even though I love his music, I just can't stand The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man And after 2 platnum albums, you call me weak Cause I don't sell records in the East Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old hoe I guess y'all fools don't know Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake You wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box While the young bitches ride on your jock You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it And stop kissing them white folks asses It's like you smoked a whole damn key You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat I'm from the old school, I love P-Funk But now rap music is all that they want So when I'm in my car, I play Clinton And when I'm on the stage I start pimping And when I hear your shit, I push eject Then I throw it out the window with the rejects And when the hard core rappers go soft I like to watch when they ass fall off Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC And any other rappers ever talk about me I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say And how I dogg bitches, every day But if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak You be phony like a side show freak Some rappers try to come off positive Where I'm from that just ain't how it is They say rap music is here to stay But the sucka MC's don't think that way It took 8 long years before I got my break So I wonder why rapper's make fake ass tapes You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk And while your in the studio, I'm in the trunk You got no choice, so don't flip that coin This ain't the military, so you punks can't join It ain't pop, it's called underground rap From Oakland California and the shit sounds phat I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies That's why they listen to the one and only I used to be broke, but now we all used to be Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me And these bitches, can't say shit to me They could never could fuck with Short baby I'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild But I do sell records like a motherfucker Even though you might I'm just another sucka I find the beat and then never switch Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch You want rent money, I got pimp money One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a hoe I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk And start slamming that Oakland funk Short Dogg's in the house, once again Trying to fade the platnum, with Shorty the Pimp And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank Withdraw some money and buy some dank You can't relate to my motherfucking homies That's why they listen to the one and only I grew up on the funk called P But these motherfuckers growing up on me And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked I take my ass back, to where I grew up And get real boy, it's never too late Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape I'm in the trunk... in the trunk, in, in the trunk in the trunk, in, in the trunk in the trunk beating down the block in the trunk, in, in the trunk in the trunk, in, in the

Cuz when I seen old movies like "Superfly" It was my destiny, to live a pimp legacy, And reach levels other niggas never see In '81 I rapped friendly, but now its on, One day I said somethin on the microphone About sixteen hoes, suckin ten toes,  People loved it, thats how the story goes It's true, in 1982, Me and Freddy B sold the tapes to you X-rated, talkin bout bitches and thugs, All the dope-dealers gettin rich sellin drugs Too $hort bumpin in the background, You thought I retired, bitch I'm back now Like a house party, or a side show, I got the spanish, black and white hoes Ask an East Oakland nigga, I bet you he know, "Is she mixed with japanese or fillapino?"

You don't like my dirty rap, you can go to hell   Cause Short Dog's on the mic spittin Cocktales. Verse1: H - E - A - D   All you washed up girls tryin to throw that P.   You're just a big freak, you better not complain   When you hear these Cocktales and you hear your name.   If you're takin, it ain't no thing   I'll pick up the phone and call Janine.   If I call Marie, I know for a fact   I'll get worked in my drop top cadillac.   I met this freak -- named Naomi   Straight head doctor, worked me and my homies.   She had a best friend, her name was Vicki   I pulled her to the side and let her lick me.   She was fine as hell, but not fine and Tina   Tina, Tina, the dick cleana!   I took her to my house and I told her, "strip!"   Baby got freaky -- started doing the splits.   I said, "Tina, you can do what you want   Cause a true blue mack won't even front."   I *** with my ***, she tried to ***   She was so ***, wouldn't give me none.   I'm sir Too $hort couldn't be no punk   I'm trying to get funky cause I love the funk.   Minus *** and her man had a little one   I didn't *** freaky ass, but it was still fun.   I know you stop and wonder what it is   It's the California lifestyle that I live.   Roll em up fat and take me a puff   And tell everybody about this freaky stuff.   I know this girl name Annette   Get her all alone and she'll do like this.   She'll freak you -- won't say no at all   Get her all alone and she'll have a ball.   I know another freak, her name's Jo Ann   I always like to *** cause I know I can.   Finest thing around, ain't got no man   Everytime she cross my mind, I go *** again.   She's like another freak named Christine   So damn dumb, I named her misdemeanor.   Cause it had to be a crime to be dumb   I toll her to my house and she let me cumm   In her mouth -- You know I work all in tip   She got my number, if she beeps me, I'm a call the trick.   And go diggin them gutts like the gardener   If she starts screamin, I'm a hump a little harder. chorus: Cause these are the tales, the Freaky Tales   These are the Tales that I cherrish so well.   You don't like my dirty rap, you can go to hell   Cause Short Dog's on the mic spittin Cocktales. verse2: I meet the groupies -- hookers like Cathy   Fuck a MC cause she's so nasty.   See her backstage tryin to throw that ass   She's just like the freaks, so she had to pass   Me that funk -- You can't stop this   Just let her roll on voes and drop her quick.   My name is Short, my game is long   I freak these freaks and sang these songs.   I know another girl named Stephanie   Do anything she can to have sex with me.   She really doesn't bring out the best in me   But, I love her fine ass laying next to me.   She's like another freak name Nicole   So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold.   I took her to my house, she gave me the panties   I dicked her so good, she told her friend name Angie.   Angie called me up about 2 weeks later   Came by the house and said do my player.   So, I dicked her just like Tamara   Taking naked pictures with my polaroid camera.   Next they told her friend name Rocquelle   Got my skin all under her fingernails.   While she was diggin in my back, I was dickin it   That was way back when, now I can't find the trick.   But if I do, I'll probably do the same again   Break her ass for everything, cause I came to pimp.   I'm Too $hort baby, I don't stop mackin   I grab the microphone and I don't stop rappin.   You can bet your life as I spit these raps   I'll be funkin em up like that.....

He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home." I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."

chick so fine So bad She made me sick some time I just had to fuck this bitch one time I met her in the galleria shopping, buying  Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that But man she had an ass so fat You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants Walked behind her whispering love songs She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit And told her try it Replied, while with these light brown eyes I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size She put it on so I paid for  Then I told her she could keep it And then I walked out the store, it's our secret But peep it Made it down the hall, she came running Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning  I don it Made a mack move and girl chased me And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces It's tasteless But honey must of missed being treated Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating Her ass behind the silly shit And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this Let's see the sights, its me tonight Let's leave him stuck home pacing Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces Chorus: You must be used to all the finer thangs Infatuated by what money brangs It seems to me you hoes will never change So all that's left is for us to exchange {Too $hort} I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it They make a nigga feel like he doing something The pussy so good have you through with money But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch Quite a few niggas got the pussy But everytime I see her got to stop and look Cause she so damn fine bitch I want to make
