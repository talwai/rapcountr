The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B. & Rakim Album: Paid In Full Song: I Ain't No Joke Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Rakim] I ain't no joke, I use to let the mic smoke Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke When I'm gone, no on gets on, cause I won't let nobody press up, and mess up, the scene I set I like to stand in the crowd, and watch the people wonder "Damn!" But think about it, then you'll understand I'm just an addict, addicted to music Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form Write a rhyme in grafitti and, every show you see me in Deep concentration, cause I'm no comedian Jokers are wild, if you wanna be tamed I treat you like a child, then you're gonna be named Another enemy, not even a friend of me Cause you'll get fried in the end, when you pretend to be competing, cause I just put your mind on pause And I complete when, you compare my rhyme with yours I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned Remember me? The one you got your idea from But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke You can't cope, you shoulda broke, because I ain't no joke {*echoes*} [Eric B. scratches] [Rakim] I got a question -- it's serious as cancer Who can keep the average dancer hyper as a heart attack, nobody smilin Cause you're expressin, the rhyme that I'm stylin This is what we all sit down to write You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch Put my tape on pause, and add some more to yours Then you figured, you're ready for the neighborhood chores A E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me So when you see me come up, freeze Or you'll be one of those seven MC's They think that I'm a new jack, but only if they knew that they who think wrong are they who can't do that style that I'm doin, they might ruin Patterns of paragraphs, based on you and your offbeat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar, I'll wait 'til E. say "Play 'em," so I'ma have to diss and bro you can get a smack for this, I ain't no joke {*echoes*} [Eric B. scratches] [Rakim] I hold the microphone like a grudge B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge I hold a conversation cause when I invent I nominated, my DJ, "The Presdient" When I see you I'll, kick a freestyle, goin steadily So pucker up, and whistle "My Melody" But whatever you do, don't miss one There'll be another rough rhyme after this one Before you know it, you're followin and fiendin Waiting for the punchline, to get the meanin Like before, the middle of my story I'm tellin Nobody beats the R, so stop yellin Save it, put it in your pocket for later Cause I'm "Moving the Crowd," and B'll wreck the fader No interruptions 'til the mic is broke When I'm gone... then you can joke! Cause everything is real on a serious tip Keep playin, and I get furious quick And I'll take you for a walk through hell Feed your dome -- then watch your eyeballs swell Guide you out of triple stage darkness When it get dark again... then I'ma spark this microphone, cause the heat is on, you see smoke And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke {*echoes*} [Eric B. scratches to the end] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B and Rakim Album: Paid in Full Song: My Melody Verse One: Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar I'm lettin knowledge be born, and my name's the R A-k-i-m not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list That's what I'm sayin, I drop science like a scientist My melody's in a code, the very next episode Has the mic often distortin, ready to explode I keep the mic in Fahrenheit, freeze MC's and make em colder The listener's system is kickin like solar As I memorize, advertise, like a poet Keep you goin when I'm flowin, smooth enough, you know it But rough that's why the middle of my story I tell E.B. Nobody beats the "R", check out my melody... Verse Two: So what if I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I sing One of these for MC's so they don't have to scream I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test Then let my melody play, and then the record suggest That I'm droppin bombs, but I stay peace and calm Any MC that disagree with me just wave your arm And I'll break, when I'm through breakin I'll leave you broke Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke So stand back, you wanna rap? All of that can wait I won't push, I won't beat around the bush I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to You might try but you can't get close to Because I'm number one, competition is none I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun Whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall I just writin my name in graffiti on the wall You shouldn't have told me you said you control me So now a contest is what you owe me Pull out your money, pull out your cut Pull up a chair, and I'ma tear shit up My name is Rakim Allah, and R & A stands for "Ra" Switch it around, but still comes out "R" So easily will I e-m-c-e-e My repetition of words is "check out my melody" Some bass and treble is moist, scratchin and cuttin a voice And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice I wouldn't have came to ?set? my name ?around the? same weak shit Puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone I take this more serious than just a poem Rockin party to party, backyard to yard Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods Verse Three: The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp I can swing off anything even a string of a harp Just turn it on and start rockin, mind no introduction Til I finish droppin science, no interruption When I approach I exercise like a coach Usin a melody and add numerous notes With the mic and the R-a-k-i-m It's a task, like a match I will strike again Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped Put in order to pursue with the momentum except I say one rhyme and I order a longer rhyme shorter A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder Verse Four: I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor Melody arranger, poet, etcetera Extra events, the grand finale like bonus I am the man they call the microphonist With wisdom which means wise words bein spoken Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin I came to express the rap I manifest Stand in my way and I'll lead a ??? words protest MC's that wanna be dissed they're gonna Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta All they can go get is me a glass of Moet A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet I take 7 MC's put em in a line And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine And that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin No fessin, no messin around, no chewin No robbin, no buyin, bitin, why bother This slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow My unusual style will confuse you a while If I was water, I flow in the Nile So many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's Just because of a cause I have to pause Right after tonight is when I prepare To catch another sucka duck MC out there Cos my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe And after this you'll call me your majesty My melody... Verse Five: Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it Eric B made a cut and advertised it My melody's created for MC's in the place Who try to listen cos I'm dissin ??? ?Take off your necklace, you try to detect my pace? ?Now? you're ?buggin? over ??? off my rhyme like bass The melody that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin Rough enough to break New York from Long Island My wisdom is swift, no matter if My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff I'm genuine like leather, don't try to be clever MC's you'll beat the "R", I'll say "Oh never" So Eric B cut it easily And check out my melody... The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B and Rakim Album: Paid in Full Song: I Know You Got Soul It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you Without a strong rhyme to step to Think of how many weak shows you slept through Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss The rhymes from the microphone soloist And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon As you hear it, pump up the volume Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow, Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control your body to dance (You got it) soul, Ditects the tempo like a red alert Reaches your reflex, so let it work When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago It can be done but only I can do it For those that can dance and clap your hands to it I start to think and then I sink Into the paper like I was ink When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, I escape when I finish the rhyme... I got soul You got it (4x) I know you got soul Picture a mic, the stage is empty A beat like this might tempt me To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) Rakim will begin when you make the mix I'll experiment like a scientist You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list 'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold You want it next? then you gotta have soul 'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore Take the mic, make the people respond for The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be If you wanna get on after me Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme Forget it and don't waste your time 'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it This is how it should be done This style is identical to none Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me I drip steam like a microphone fiend Eager to MC is my theme I get hype when I hear a drum roll Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul You got it (5x) I got soul (you got it) that's why I came To teach those who can't say my name First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller Rakim gets stronger as I get older Constant elevation causes expansion I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion Then put it on tape and in the city I test it Then on the radio the R's requested You listen to it, the concept might break you 'Cause almost anyone can relate to... Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles Or should I just let him melt? Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul You got it (4x) Now I'm a stop to see what you got Get off the mic before I get too hot I want to see which posse can dance the best It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, Even other states come right and exact, It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at Since you came here, you have to show and prove And do that dance until it don't move 'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace You got it (10x) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B. and Rakim Album: Paid in Full Song: Move the Crowd Verse one: Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this Fever, was it me or either summer madness Cuz I just can't stand around So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate Cuz When i heard the beat, I just had to make Something from the top of my head So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said How could I move the crowd First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed Here's the instruction, put it together It simple ain't it but quite clever Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years But weak ideas irritate my ears Is this the best that you can make? Cuz if not and you got more, I'll wait But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on  The dancefloor when they put something smooth on So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud Cuz I like to move the crowd Move the crowd... Verse two: Imagine me wit the heat that's made by solar, It gets stronger everytime I hold a Microphone, check the tone to get started The line for the microphone is departed So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing Everyone is moving or eager to listen Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut! Cuz I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut For those that know me, indeed I like to flow Especially when the music's going slow It gives me a chance to let everybody know It's time to bust out the Rakim show I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise Right in front of your eyes cuz I am a surprise So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve At 360 degrees, I revolve This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven, Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving Move the crowd...

That brother struck again" Cuz mic by mic and stage by stage, Tape by tape and page by page, When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix The rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets Deeper and Deeper - I hope you understand it I made it up myself and I planned it For other MC's who waste time  Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme I cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating The rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' To get up on the microphone and then start takin' Control of the mic - uptight when I grabbed it So hug the speaker- your ear's a magnet Attracted to a freestyle put in effect You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, I want you to hear this perfectly clear Catch what I'm sayin'?

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B and Rakim Album: Follow the Leader Song: Microphone Fiend I was a fiend before I became a teen I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated 'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, " Yes y'all!" They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab So then I add all the rhymes I had One after the other one, then I make another one To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean? I'm raging, ripping up the stage and Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and Thought of, Cuz it's sort of...an addiction, Magnatized by the mixing Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting, Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing Everything is written in the cold, so it can coin- cide, my thoughts to guide, 48 tracks to slide The invincible, microphone fiend Rakim Spread the word, 'cause I'm in  E-F-F-E-C-T A smooth operator operating correctly, But back to the problem, I gotta habit, You can't solve it, silly rabbit The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when I fiend for a microphone like herion Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness? Beware, it's the reanamator! A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping You see a part of me that you never seen When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend... (Verse 2:) After 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling The thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified But this ain't the cinemas of "Tales From the Darkside", By any means neccesary, this is what has to be done Make way 'cause here I come.... My DJ cuts material.... Grand imperial. It's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me, It's inherited, it's runs in the family I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back, If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack. Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off You didn't keep the stage warm, step off! Ladies and Gentleman, You're about to see A pasttime hobby about to be Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one- Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke More than cracked up, you should have backed up For those who act up need to be more than smacked up Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber One on one and I'm the remainder! So close your eyes and hold your breath, And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death Before you go, you'll remember you seen The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend The microphone fiend...

But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park, Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a spark; Ya tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up, What's that, lighten up! You see a sight but, Suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick, You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick! Music's the clue, when I come your warned, Apocolypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone! Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer? This is the death penalty,and I'm servin' a death wish, so come on, step to this hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist! Friday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street, you come in my realm ya get beat! This is off limits, so your visions are blurry, All ya see is the meters at a volume,  pumping Lyrics of Fury! it's a ....fearified freestyle! Terror in the styles, never error-files, indeed I'm known-your exiled! For those that oppose to be level or next to this... I ain't a devil and this ain't the Exorcist! worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink, the pain's a migraine every time ya think, Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear: The R-A-K-I-M in your ear; Then the beat is hysterical, that makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack, soon the lyrical format is superior, faces of death remain,  MC's decaying, cuz they never stayed, the scene of a crime every night at the show, the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know, It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable, melodies-unmakable, pattern-unecscapable, a horn if want the style I posses,  I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest, for those that envy a MC it can be, hazardous to your health so be friendly, a matter of life and death, just like a ethch-a-sketch, shake 'till your clear, make it disappear, make the next, after the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in peace, if not, my soul'll release! the scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made it, cuz your about to see a disasterous sight, a performance never again performed on a mic: Lyrics of fury! a fearified freestyle! the "R" is in the house-too much tension!

No mic-to-mouth resuscitation is neccessary; no obituary, and if they're left, they're buried. As it strikes on the same mic twice and then, cut it on, and I'm-a strike again. I meditate off the breaks, till the place shakes, then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes. Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother. The stage is stompin' grounds -- run for cover.   (scratching) Evacuate the building, danger, cuz I came to explain the strategy that'll be tragic automatically, havin' me to cause another catastrophe. All you gotta do is give Rakim the microphone and the crowd'll yell "Timber." Buildings collapsin', rappers gettin' trapped in, areas closed off, no one gets back in. So set up roadblocks, barracade the doors, fade, put a detour sign on the stage. Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use and been usin' ever since the days in the park when, rap was an art then. Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned. Makin' it hard to walk the streets at night  for those who talk the weak beats on the mic. Whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage. Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge. Surround by sound of the beat-down another brother, this is stompin' grounds, run for cover. Wheels or foot, better not stay put. Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked. Then you've got seven minutes to vacate the premises. Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes. Don't act wild, single file to the door. No need for an encore, just clear the floor. Cuz my mic's about to self destruct, the stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt. So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned, cuz minutes from now it won't be standin'. Then send out and A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a brother like me. Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture? How many bitin' MCs can I capture? Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth; take over their route, play 'em out like a Cub Scout. So leave troopin' for MCs at war,  and if it's a battle let the crowd keep score. Cuz me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother...run for cover.

I'm untouchable Put on my thinking cap pump the track Test your reflex relax but in contact you fold and lose control so hold your partner closer you're supposed to keep your composure But you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype it's like nitro opponents get petro Remember the trademark left by the R that's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest in effect, you could die-tect the imposter Takin my props, Rakim is still proper I'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it Everything I say, coincide with the topic Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured Inside my brain it's all manufactured As we go deeper it's hard to find Don't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined in the mind with some kind of idea for the style I'm advertisin what is true Keep advised that you stay wise and the mind is untouchable The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B and Rakim Album: Let the Rhythm Hit Em Song: Mahogany Verse One: Me and Eric B was coolin' at the Paladium Seen a all-world covered girl, I said "Hey lady I'm  Sorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up Or interveen or interrupt, but. . .

'Cause every dish I make tastes great and Plus filling, If I sold a third of my rhymes, I make a killing, Get the salt and pepper from the maid Get the blood off the blade, pass the hand grenade If you try this, your response is tonsilitis, I'm leaving authors and writers with arthritis; You got the slightest ideas, I got the brightest Here's the lightest, so clear, it's out of sight, it's Darkness, from the darkness, came the light The night is the time for Ra to recite it.

President Bush said attack Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back Missile hits the area, screams wake me up from a war of dreams, heat up the M-16 Basic training, trained for torture Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya Addicted to murder, send more bodybags They can't identify em, leave the nametags I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor CASUALTIES OF WAR!

Who's on the other side of the wall? Somebody give the President a call But I hear warfare scream through the air Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme Something like Monopoly: a government scheme Go to the Army, be all you can be Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me So I start letting off ammunition in every direction Allah is my only protection But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same and this is Asia, from where I came I'm on the wrong side, so change the target Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant?

New York could be over, G Kamikaze, strapped with bombs No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? No time to wonder, somebody's going under Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge Take control, cause I'm in charge When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor CASUALTIES OF WAR!

[Rakim] I don't stress my day cause it's best to parlay I guess you could say I've been away I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant and fourteen hands comb New York for fans They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread A mornin massage turnin into a real rough rubdown so I figured I'll lay around They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me They know more than calisthetics as they worked up a sweat It wasn't even ten o'clock yet Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean They sweetly keep me squeaky clean I chill as they filled the jacuzzi I said, "I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me Support my thoughts, cause I got a lot of writing to do" They said, "Cool," and just enjoyed the view It ain't hard cause it's miles from the sidewalk I'm overlookin every borough in New York The entire, Empire, State to concentrate for every rhyme I make So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune And just before they all cleared the room they said, "We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure We wish you didn't have to leave no more" But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door 	Double oh seven is back.. Rest assured 	Double oh seven is back.. Feel secure 	Double oh seven is back.. I'm fillin up the page when I'm steppin on stage Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air Fellas sayin HOE, everybody yellin GO Fly ladies in the house all screamin "awww yeah" That's how they react when I attack the mic In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright Girls love to squeeze me real tight Double oh seven is back.. Ra has returned, to romance em, better than Johnny Handsome When I was young, women said, "Damn son" Ain't nuthin change but the year and I'm still here C'mere dear and let me whisper in your ear Hug my words so I can taste your lips I set up hips like domino chips but I don't let em hit the floor And if you got sore, then feel secure Where's the pain, is it the spot you set us in Almost magic, better than medicine Take one of these and put your mind at ease I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s If I'm hawkin New York, or out on tour I express the raw dialect and explore But don't get fooled by metaphor 		Double oh seven is back Rest assured Feel secure Rest assured Rest assured Yo, feel secure The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B. and Rakim Album: Don't Sweat the Technique Song: The Punisher Kill him again! Try to identufy the man in front of ya But it ain't the role, the gear, or the money, the swift intellectionist with pleny, ya bite, if it's dark I'll spark every one of ya, I throw a mic in the crowd, it's a question, I got the answer..it includes directions: "Go manufacture a mask, show me after a glass of a master that has to make musical massacre..." Attack your wack 'till it's handicapped, you'll never hold the mic again, try to hand it back, cuz every rapper that comes, I cut off his thumbs, put a record to his neck, if he swallows it hums! Slice from ear to ear-so 'till can hear better, Before he bleed to death, here, hear every letter! and you can see quick and thick the blood can get if you try to change the style or the subject; as I get deep in the rhyme I'm becomin' a emcee murderer...before I'm done, I'm a prepare the chamber, the torture's comin' up, Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's the punisher.... Kill 'em again! I hold the mic as hostage, emcees are ransome, rhymes'll punish 'em cuz they don't undertsand 'em, I heat up his brain, then explain then I hand him a redhot microphone...that's how I planned 'em, rhymes call information(?), unite midnught(?), like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic, if ya curse me, it ain't no mercy, give him a autopsy, killed by a verse of me, I took a kid and cut off his eyelid, kill him slow so he could see what I did, and if he don't understand what I said, I'm pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head so he can see what he's getting into, a part of the mind that he never been through, a journey is coming cuz ya getting sent to  a place harder to find but it's all in the mental, I ran a brainscan to locate his game plan, when I'm through with his brain he ain't the same, man! did he lose his mind or lost in his mind, but this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find your foundation; coasting, your mind is drifting, in slow motion..frozen, looks like another murder at the Mardi Gras, B! Too late to send out a search party, once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back, I give 'em a map, but he still get trapped, so prepare the chamber, the torture's coming up, trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher.... Kill 'em again! Dangerous rhymes (are) performed like surgery, Cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy, My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex, your cerebellum is next!  Your conscience becomes sub-conscious, soon your response is nonsense.... the last words are blurred...mumbled then slurred, then your verbs are no longer heard, you get your lung fried so good you're tongue-tied, he couldn't swing or hang so he hung 'till he died, reincarnate him...and kill him again...again and again...again and again... I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him, I got a dead-MC'ing museum, when I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em, you can't save 'em...there's no ultamatum, mic's lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes, got a long list and I'm a get every one of ya... Beware of The Punisher! Then I'm a kill 'em again! Wake 'em up...kill 'em again!

What's going on? What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man You invented a scam even you don't understand You rig the enigma, can't figure it out You change the route, now you're in doubt You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed, Figured you was all that but that ain't last; The times is harder, the drugs is heavier You say whatever, the more, the merrier; Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes, Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes; No more good times, no more time, Too far to find, you're almost blind, You can't see what spot that the trap is in... (Hey bra!)What's happening! You had it mapped out, your plans get torn, You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone You said you quit, stated your word is bond (Hey bro) what's going on? What's going on? My neighborhood don't look so good I'll find a way out.. yeah, I would if I could, But the government is doing a project...  so I live in the projects; Where we fight for elbow room to the doom, Try to live long but you die too soon, I might not be alive to see 25, Taught at ten to make money and strive; I sold tapes at school and made some ends Met alot of skins and even made some friends, Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit, Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit; But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test, But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress! And then shake hands like a man, 'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand! But you had a one on one fight wit drugs, When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs, Clip after clip, until one of us is gone... (Hey bra!) what's going on? Yo, what's going on? The crime rate in New York State elevate, A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate, Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt, Kids on the playground shot down and kilt! Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more... 'Cause stray bullets explore! We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely, And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be Rubbed out in a quest for clout The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out! Half of the projects is dead or locked up, Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up. Human abortion create distortions... And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born....! (Hey bra!) what's going on?

Standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge Let's see if I know the ledge Corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here I get cock-d liffin' forty's of beer; Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased If I get revenge, then they rest in peace Somebody's got to suffer, I just might spare one And give a brother a fair one! Stay alert and on "p's" And I do work with these- like Hercules Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw 'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall Smooth but I move like an army Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me Putting brothers to rest like Elliot ness 'Cause I don't like stress Streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand Nutting's gonna stop the plan I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro Black Gambino, die like a hero Living on shaky grounds too close to the edge Let's see if I know the ledge! Shells lay around on the battleground Dead bodies are found throughout the town Tried to put shame in my game to make a name, I'm a Put it on a bullet, put it in your brain Rip the block like a buckshot Who cares where it goes, just keep the casket closed No remorse when a life is lost I paid my dues- paid the cost! ...And my pockets are still fat Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat Even if my crew steep with one deep I attract attention, people like to peep So come say hi to the badguy Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die! 'Cause I get loose and I got troops... And crazy juice! In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini Hang out wit Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat But no warning shot, my gun is warm a lot When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear Areas interfere but this here's severe! Living life too close to the edge Hoping that I know the ledge... A brand new morn, no time to yawn Shower's on, power's on Late for school, I catch the train Girls sip Cristal and whisper my name I push up like an exercise Check the intellect and inspect the thighs Select the best one, pull her to the side  Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride    Read my resume she's know I'm 'ready cool      Just meet me after school We can moan and groan until your mom come home And you be calling me Al "dope" Capone Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety Cause alot of niggaz hate me Coming out of the building, they set me up Sprayed wit automatics, they wet me up In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge I guess I didn't know the ledge...

Too quick to pause it, you almost lost it So kick along to you're all exhausted And look what my data made! my power'll never fade I keep it energetic, or hype as Gatorade... Now kick it wit a beat C'mon, kick along Kick along(3x) They can't wait to kick steps to this So I make a skit just for kicks Syncopated, pausing though, Innovated 'cause the flow Melodic and melodramatic styles occur, Like a choreographer, my mind's a photographer Making music visible for the individual That gets visual What I manifest you express on the dance floor Pants get torn when the jam is on 'Cause I kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back It's hard to kick that, where did'cha get that Here's the concept, part of you're concert Expect the expert to perfect and do work.

They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab So then I add all the rhymes I had One after the other one, then I make another one To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean? I'm raging, ripping up the stage and Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and Thought of, Cuz it's sort of...an addiction, Magnatized by the mixing Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting, Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing Everything is written in the cold, so it can coin- cide, my thoughts to guide, 48 tracks to slide The invincible, microphone fiend Rakim Spread the word, 'cause I'm in  E-F-F-E-C-T A smooth operator operating correctly, But back to the problem, I gotta habit, You can't solve it, silly rabbit The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when I fiend for a microphone like herion Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness? Beware, it's the reanamator! A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping You see a part of me that you never seen When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend... (Verse 2:) After 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling The thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified But this ain't the cinemas of "Tales From the Darkside", By any means neccesary, this is what has to be done Make way 'cause here I come.... My DJ cuts material.... Grand imperial. It's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me, It's inherited, it's runs in the family I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back, If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack. Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off You didn't keep the stage warm, step off! Ladies and Gentleman, You're about to see A pasttime hobby about to be Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one- Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke More than cracked up, you should have backed up For those who act up need to be more than smacked up Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber One on one and I'm the remainder! So close your eyes and hold your breath, And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death Before you go, you'll remember you seen The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend The microphone fiend...

But think about it, then you'll understand I'm just an addict, addicted to music Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form Write a rhyme in grafitti and, every show you see me in Deep concentration, cause I'm no comedian Jokers are wild, if you wanna be tamed I treat you like a child, then you're gonna be named Another enemy, not even a friend of me Cause you'll get fried in the end, when you pretend to be competing, cause I just put your mind on pause And I complete when, you compare my rhyme with yours I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned Remember me? The one you got your idea from But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke You can't cope, you shoulda broke, because I ain't no joke {*echoes*} [Eric B. scratches] [Rakim] I got a question -- it's serious as cancer Who can keep the average dancer hyper as a heart attack, nobody smilin Cause you're expressin, the rhyme that I'm stylin This is what we all sit down to write You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch Put my tape on pause, and add some more to yours Then you figured, you're ready for the neighborhood chores A E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me So when you see me come up, freeze Or you'll be one of those seven MC's They think that I'm a new jack, but only if they knew that they who think wrong are they who can't do that style that I'm doin, they might ruin Patterns of paragraphs, based on you and your offbeat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar, I'll wait 'til E. say "Play 'em," so I'ma have to diss and bro you can get a smack for this, I ain't no joke {*echoes*} [Eric B. scratches] [Rakim] I hold the microphone like a grudge B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge I hold a conversation cause when I invent I nominated, my DJ, "The Presdient" When I see you I'll, kick a freestyle, goin steadily So pucker up, and whistle "My Melody" But whatever you do, don't miss one There'll be another rough rhyme after this one Before you know it, you're followin and fiendin Waiting for the punchline, to get the meanin Like before, the middle of my story I'm tellin Nobody beats the R, so stop yellin Save it, put it in your pocket for later Cause I'm "Moving the Crowd," and B'll wreck the fader No interruptions 'til the mic is broke When I'm gone... then you can joke! Cause everything is real on a serious tip Keep playin, and I get furious quick And I'll take you for a walk through hell Feed your dome -- then watch your eyeballs swell Guide you out of triple stage darkness When it get dark again... then I'ma spark this microphone, cause the heat is on, you see smoke And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke {*echoes*} [Eric B. scratches to the end] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eric B. and Rakim Album: Follow the Leader   Song: Lyrics of Fury Verse one: I'm rated "R"...this is a warning, ya better void, Poets are paranoid, DJ's D-stroyed, Cuz I came back to attack others in spite- Strike like lightnin', It's quite frightenin'! But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park, Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a spark; Ya tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up, What's that, lighten up! You see a sight but, Suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick, You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick! Music's the clue, when I come your warned, Apocolypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone! Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer? This is the death penalty,and I'm servin' a death wish, so come on, step to this hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist! Friday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street, you come in my realm ya get beat! This is off limits, so your visions are blurry, All ya see is the meters at a volume,  pumping Lyrics of Fury! it's a ....fearified freestyle! Terror in the styles, never error-files, indeed I'm known-your exiled! For those that oppose to be level or next to this... I ain't a devil and this ain't the Exorcist! worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink, the pain's a migraine every time ya think, Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear: The R-A-K-I-M in your ear; Then the beat is hysterical, that makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack, soon the lyrical format is superior, faces of death remain,  MC's decaying, cuz they never stayed, the scene of a crime every night at the show, the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know, It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable, melodies-unmakable, pattern-unecscapable, a horn if want the style I posses,  I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest, for those that envy a MC it can be, hazardous to your health so be friendly, a matter of life and death, just like a ethch-a-sketch, shake 'till your clear, make it disappear, make the next, after the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in peace, if not, my soul'll release! the scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made it, cuz your about to see a disasterous sight, a performance never again performed on a mic: Lyrics of fury! a fearified freestyle! the "R" is in the house-too much tension! Make sure the system's loud when I mention Phrases that's fearsome... You want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums; I sit back and observe the whole scenery,  then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me, strictly business I'm quickly in this mood, and I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness! I'm a tear you apart but I'm a spare you a heart, program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start, rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craziest musical madness MC ever made, see it's now an emergency, open-heart surgery... open your mind, you will find every word'll be furier than ever, I remain the furture, battle's tempting...whatever suits ya! For words the sentence, there's no resemblance, you think you're ruffer, then suffer the consequences! I'm never dying-terrifying results, I wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts, mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation, novicane ease the pain it might save him, if not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury...

Nobody beats the "R", check out my melody... Verse Two: So what if I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I sing One of these for MC's so they don't have to scream I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test Then let my melody play, and then the record suggest That I'm droppin bombs, but I stay peace and calm Any MC that disagree with me just wave your arm And I'll break, when I'm through breakin I'll leave you broke Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke So stand back, you wanna rap? All of that can wait I won't push, I won't beat around the bush I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to You might try but you can't get close to Because I'm number one, competition is none I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun Whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall I just writin my name in graffiti on the wall You shouldn't have told me you said you control me So now a contest is what you owe me Pull out your money, pull out your cut Pull up a chair, and I'ma tear shit up My name is Rakim Allah, and R & A stands for "Ra" Switch it around, but still comes out "R" So easily will I e-m-c-e-e My repetition of words is "check out my melody" Some bass and treble is moist, scratchin and cuttin a voice And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice I wouldn't have came to ?set? my name ?around the? same weak shit Puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone I take this more serious than just a poem Rockin party to party, backyard to yard Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods Verse Three: The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp I can swing off anything even a string of a harp Just turn it on and start rockin, mind no introduction Til I finish droppin science, no interruption When I approach I exercise like a coach Usin a melody and add numerous notes With the mic and the R-a-k-i-m It's a task, like a match I will strike again Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped Put in order to pursue with the momentum except I say one rhyme and I order a longer rhyme shorter A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder Verse Four: I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor Melody arranger, poet, etcetera Extra events, the grand finale like bonus I am the man they call the microphonist With wisdom which means wise words bein spoken Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin I came to express the rap I manifest Stand in my way and I'll lead a ??? words protest MC's that wanna be dissed they're gonna Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta All they can go get is me a glass of Moet A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet I take 7 MC's put em in a line And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine And that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin No fessin, no messin around, no chewin No robbin, no buyin, bitin, why bother This slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow My unusual style will confuse you a while If I was water, I flow in the Nile So many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's Just because of a cause I have to pause Right after tonight is when I prepare To catch another sucka duck MC out there Cos my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe And after this you'll call me your majesty My melody... Verse Five: Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it Eric B made a cut and advertised it My melody's created for MC's in the place Who try to listen cos I'm dissin ??? ?Take off your necklace, you try to detect my pace? ?Now? you're ?buggin? over ??? off my rhyme like bass The melody that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin Rough enough to break New York from Long Island My wisdom is swift, no matter if My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff I'm genuine like leather, don't try to be clever MC's you'll beat the "R", I'll say "Oh never" So Eric B cut it easily And check out my melody...

In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini Hang out wit Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat But no warning shot, my gun is warm a lot When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear Areas interfere but this here's severe! Living life too close to the edge Hoping that I know the ledge... A brand new morn, no time to yawn Shower's on, power's on Late for school, I catch the train Girls sip Cristal and whisper my name I push up like an exercise Check the intellect and inspect the thighs Select the best one, pull her to the side  Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride    Read my resume she's know I'm 'ready cool      Just meet me after school We can moan and groan until your mom come home And you be calling me Al "dope" Capone Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety Cause alot of niggaz hate me Coming out of the building, they set me up Sprayed wit automatics, they wet me up In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge I guess I didn't know the ledge...

Cuz if not and you got more, I'll wait But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on  The dancefloor when they put something smooth on So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud Cuz I like to move the crowd Move the crowd... Verse two: Imagine me wit the heat that's made by solar, It gets stronger everytime I hold a Microphone, check the tone to get started The line for the microphone is departed So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing Everyone is moving or eager to listen Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut! Cuz I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut For those that know me, indeed I like to flow Especially when the music's going slow It gives me a chance to let everybody know It's time to bust out the Rakim show I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise Right in front of your eyes cuz I am a surprise So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve At 360 degrees, I revolve This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven, Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving Move the crowd...

(4X) Day divides the night and night divides the day It's all hard work and no play More than combat, it's far beyond that Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall? Somebody give the President a call But I hear warfare scream through the air Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme Something like Monopoly: a government scheme Go to the Army, be all you can be Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me So I start letting off ammunition in every direction Allah is my only protection But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same and this is Asia, from where I came I'm on the wrong side, so change the target Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant?

New York could be over, G Kamikaze, strapped with bombs No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?

Too late to send out a search party, once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back, I give 'em a map, but he still get trapped, so prepare the chamber, the torture's coming up, trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher.... Kill 'em again! Dangerous rhymes (are) performed like surgery, Cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy, My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex, your cerebellum is next!  Your conscience becomes sub-conscious, soon your response is nonsense.... the last words are blurred...mumbled then slurred, then your verbs are no longer heard, you get your lung fried so good you're tongue-tied, he couldn't swing or hang so he hung 'till he died, reincarnate him...and kill him again...again and again...again and again... I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him, I got a dead-MC'ing museum, when I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em, you can't save 'em...there's no ultamatum, mic's lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes, got a long list and I'm a get every one of ya...

want  Tell me what you want, I give it to you the way you want  Show you how to flow and how to flip any phrase you want  You just keep your eye on me  I show you how to emcee  If it's swag or the lyric display you want  Tell me what you want, I give it to you the way you want  Show you how to throw and how to rip any stage you want  I can show you how to emcee  Like you got a degree  [ VERSE 1: Rakim ]  This is your Qu'ran or Bible  To be a true MC, icon and idol  The contents you put in your songs are vital  Like training for the UFC you want a title  Slam thoughts on the canvas, flip 'em and pin 'em  Metaphors and similes with synonyms in 'em  Spit heat around the town, the more you get it heard  Till you spit at least 3000 miles before it hit a curve  Then flaunt your rhymes in your rap pages  Wordplay to punchlines and catchphrases  Deep sport for players and ballers, new game  Street talk straight off the corners, new slang  I got heat for crowds for those that pursue it  Spitters, I show you flow till your vocals are through it  From social to freestyle, just focus into it  If you a G I'll show you how the Coppola do it  [ CHORUS ]  [ VERSE 2: Rakim ]  Forever sick like catchin AIDS is  In a class for greatness for matchin phrases  My predicates last for pages  Every letter fit, trendsetter like fashion statements  Recruits get a shine and they hope forever  I wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put together  Soon as I make 'em rappers take 'em  Analyze 'em for days and paraphrase 'em  I'm back, hip-hoppers'll back my scripts and documents  Raps hit the block, it's a wrap, it's the apocalypse  The hood give my rap flow names  Like 9/11 and crack cocaine  I hit the building, it get hotter in 'em  It's like birds, most rappers don't know how to flip 'em  I gotta hip 'em, get hop and show 'em how to spit 'em  I bust a rhyme and I school 'em for free, I scholarship 'em  [ CHORUS ]  [ BRIDGE: Tracey Horton ]  Competition know the deal, you're not

No sir, ghostwriter, you can kill that  [ VERSE 3: Rakim ]  It's hard ( ? ) it isn't in bars, it's infinite  So Ra deliver it far different  Part lyricist, part instrument  Start spittin it the more articulate y'all rhythms get  Till every syllable you drop it pivotal  If it's not original it's not as memorable  Ill lyrical till you're so popular they sick of you  Pandemical threat, level 5, it's critical  Kill 'em off with a word like euthanasia  Till it spread to the youth in Asia  In the booth I'm major, my music's monumental, I'm a mogul  You wanna make sense? I'ma show you  You gotta put your life in them lines  Make the deaf hear, give sight to the blind  Make your flow tighter, brightest designs  So if the mic is your grind then biting's a crime  Especially if a ghostwriter's writin your rhymes The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Rakim f/ Maino, Tracey Horton  Album: The Seventh Seal Song: Walk These Streets Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com [Tracey Horton - Intro] (Rakim) La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah (Uh...yeah...)

strikes again Elements burst and gave birth to the first Get the pen from the nurse and hook the mic up first When it absolutely positively has to be there on time I deliver a rhyme  The heckler of hip hop, hop to this one I got more kid, they hate to miss one Style got jazz and the crowd's out of control Cause I've got the mic and I've got the soul New York's own microphone technician Thoughts'll give 'em visions Style'll make you listen Devastates the ear, my opponents can't see me I gave 'em directions, but wrote it in graffiti But they wanna know my m.o. ease back though They want the exact flow, then study my steelo Sketch the skit, but they still can't see what I did I heat the mic up kid I keep the mic hot, I heat it up kid I keep the mic hot, I heat it up (x4) Then I explode with a song with a original form Or I'll perform it at high mode, they want the code Destroyed the blueprints and documents and hits Crews been, um, looking for clues ever since Beats start brewing up, rhymes is rough Stages and microphones self-destruct And when you thought you had the format down pat You get kicked back to the doormat with that Cause I've got a high tech style with know-how Select the file watch the crowd go wild Bad beats to bless the females' finesse Points shot stress causing cardiac arrest Mics too hot for you to told in your hands Now they sell 'em with fifteen fans and mic stands Mine still overheats, if you touch it you can see what I did I heat the mic up kid I keep the mic hot, I heat it up kid I keep the mic hot, I heat it up (x4) If his opponents'll run a rap, tell 'em ease back I've got a knapsack with hip hop attacks Stacks of artifacts, formats in the act Tracks after macs, and you can't relax Rakim's equipped with penmanship Left my penmate, I could graduate from Penn State I could take any trade and make a high grade Even get extra credit when the rhyme's displayed As soon as I manifest, they cheat off my test Surround my desk and then stress the progress But they miss the point, forget the skit I'll bust your lip if you rip the script Brother's ain't cool and I'mma smoke up the room And I've got a crew called the last platoon Figure it out kid, problems coming Emcees are running cause I'm the gunman Extremely dangerous I bust rhymes into the crowd And watch 'em all scream out loud Aw man, and then I slam like a batteram Ra got the plan with your favorite jam I keep the mic hot, I heat it up kid I keep the mic hot, I heat it up (x4) The last platoon Rakim You know what I mean?

Growing up swinging, through my upbringing My limits is the sky from the all eye seeing Of so-called realities filled with technicalities I watch my steps, stay on my p's and check my casualties Not to get played, equipped with all the tricks of the trade I even learned from the mistakes that the next man made I know to choose and pick the people I grow up around I know to grow and get to know the town up and down But there's no instructions, so many directions A lot of crooks look to get hooked with connections Some thought they knew all adolescence could teach They graduated from school but fail life in the streets Your pops taught you to strive and stay a live, no ditty It's easy to die when you're living for the city That's how I'm living (x3) Yeah that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yep that's how I'm living I grow according to my environmental habitat I hang where everything seem to happen at I seen it all, and I've been doing that since I was small Catch a flashback y'all, if I can recall The days on the corner we watched the world go by Or nights that wasn't right like when a good friend dies I quest for the best for prepare for the worst Never scared but I cared if I'm blessed or I'm cursed Yes I fear no man but Allah I'm Gomar Oras Dubar Which is God so It's hard to see Ra I do what I gotta do, with or without a clue Run through any obstacle including you Cause I ain't got to bust you, cause I got the muscle A push any clown that tries to slow down my hustle I gotta get by, but there's no time for pity It's easy to die when you're living for the city That's how I'm living (x3) Yeah that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yep that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yep that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yeah that's how I'm living I'm in a zone everywhere I seem to roam is home A rolling stone, I hold my own just like a microphone I stay in tune, travel in harmony and set the tone Being young but I'm grown and well-known Try to take me out New York but you can't take New York out of me Cause that's the only way that I know how to be My neighbors is jealous they label us drug sellers We may be hood dwellers, we're just a bunch of goodfellas Cause we run wild with a passion, my style and my fashion Is getting, kid, I'm making cash and crashing Parties that everybody's talking about, we turn it out I'm just a native New Yorker with clout I know my way around any borough and any town I make a lot of ground and I'm hard to be found I get down to the nitty gritty, wake up with something pretty It gets me through another day living for the city That's how I'm living (x3) Yeah that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yep that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yep that's how I'm living That's how I'm living (x3) Yeah that's how I'm living The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Alicia Keys f/ Nas, Rakim Album: Streets of New York 12" Song: Streets of New York Typed by: PDog1217@aol.com  [Nas] (Alicia Keys) Nasty, yeah, yeah (New York, New York) Hey yo black it's time again, yeah, yeah (New York, New York) Come here, yeah, yeah (New York, New York) Hey yo black it's time (*"yeah, yeah, hey yo black it's time" -
