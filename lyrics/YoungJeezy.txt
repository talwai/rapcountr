Hahaaa Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute? I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me Say "Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?" I told him "Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty" Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go [Verse 1] I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy From the city where them young niggas die skinny Keep work on deck if you need any Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me! Got the weight of the world on my shoulders And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready Feels like I was born for this If not, at least I'll die for it They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it The big question is what can I do for the youth? Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth [Hook] "I'm a hustler!" So, one man, one stage, one mic One song, one chance to get it right I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night And I think I know the way, follow me "I got hustle!" One man, one stage, one mic One song, one chance to get it right I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night And I think I know the way, follow me "I'm a hustler!" [Verse 2] Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds Fresh out, right back chasin bread My life's so hard, so concrete I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street Take me for instance My life is not about you, think me for instance I did the impossible, I made it out Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on Stuntin in traffic like "This my car" Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her Just ball around, you know, buy her some things Lovin every minute of it, still breakin chains [Hook] [Verse 3] Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional Same picture, see it one of three ways Let it marinate, it might take a few days They say all I talk about is drugs and violence So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense Words to live by, took it out of context They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash So I look forward to the future Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have Partly cloudy so I need a forecast Where's the weatherman at when you need him? A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin tell him [Hook] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Young Jeezy f/ USDA Album: U.S.D.A.

it from another dream I sat up alone in my palace Drenched in both sweat My blood shut eyes were exposed by the sun raze And being that I was alone I was all exposed to myself The silence that was going in my head As I stepped out on the city Chico there was a time when nobody believed in me I always knew to look above it And now, I'm looking above them I want them to know about the struggle The hussle, And what to they know about adversities anyways Ye, I come from the slums, but so what? I could repeat it to you a hundred times if I want I could write it in a letter But nothing will let you know I'm Jefe More than my cold silence I can't help that we're the greatest It's what they put us here for And like that (Es el mundo) We're gone!

Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment Whether gettin money legally or ILLEGALLY We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man! Yeah! Grew up a screw up baby Got introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet Let's go! [Ludacris] Ever since I was an embryo, waitin to shape up and ship out Somethin in my brain said, "Wake up and kick out!" Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out Peace out, A-Town gone and then I dipped out And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out Somebody get him, the lil' nigga's out of control Put a lil' bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold Gold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent The essence of adolescence got my body feelin fresh'n fresh'n fresh'n, and it was a blessin to rhyme and start reppin I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a tec's And I'm a heavyweight you niggaz is lighter than my complexion [Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. sample variations repeat 4X] [Young Jeezy] Ayyyy Y'all already know what it is I'ma tell you nigga C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5 Homey fronted me a sip, shit I made it a bird That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word Say the, ice is cool but them pots is hot You better cook slow but that money come fast I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash You know the kid pimpin all over the world A hundred carats got me all over your girl YEAHHHHHHHHHHH, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag A corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle I got a Field Mob that'll +Disturb+ your +Peace+ Blowin Sean Jay, all we do is smoke Finish countin my bread and I was gettin some head Whassup? [Ludacris] I'ma be all the way real with this, look When I came into the game they ain't do nuttin but doubt me Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nuttin without me Pickin up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions From hangin on the block to throwin parties in the Hamptons From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA From dice on the curb to stackin up chips, but harder From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your women dawg I went from ashy to classy Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doin the nasty Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playin your cards Boyyy!
