Make it fast so we can be on our way Kick in the rings and everything, ok?" The kid was nervous and flinching And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin Closer and closer, put the gun to his head Shorty was down to catch a body instead Money was scared so he panicked Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic  But shorty said, "Now" pulled the trigger and stepped It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to

those creampuffs about the schemes that they dreamed of About the way they slayed this one or that one but won't step to me, cause they know the last one who tried to match the panache of the Guru received a curse that was much worse than voodoo Cause the effect of my voice is immense It would make more sense if suckers hide in the basement But yo I don't look for hassles, my rhymes are like

of the Name The meaning of the name GangStarr, well I'll tell ya It means I find my mind can excel to a greater type of thought, brought by the things that I've been taught in relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine with a sense of confidence Accomplishments, are achieved off lots of gifts But slopiness, I could never tolerate it Not the Guru nor Premier you don't know how long we've waited While other groups have faded, just like haircuts We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain to expose every vain Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame You've got no beats, so you get no seats at this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable Kane and Able, jealous brothers And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track It means that nothing can be wack The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power Not withstood by any mortal or immortal To make you get on the floor til another dope jam we slam with precision Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism or reflections, through a spectrum And all the soft silly suckers I'ma wet them in other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame... This is the meaning of the name (DJ Premier cuts "what does it all mean?") [Guru] GangStarr, it means a lot to me It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically Gang represents my boys or a posse So just back up off me And the Starr symbolizes the power Making the suckers and weak brothers cower We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense Crazy offense, and stupid defense Now, have I made myself clear? Or do I have to call on DJ Premier? For he and I make up the songs that you long for Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door Waiting for a call or for the doors to open Cause they're hoping, that they'll get chosen But to be chosen is a divine gift You better get a job quick See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak You oughta take a peak and check out the technique Seek, and you shall find GangStarr stands for mastermind Simple and plain and yo this ain't no game lame...

tell me life was meant to be like this a black man in a world dominated by whiteness Ever since the declaration of independence we've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence It goes: all men are created equal that's why corrupt governments kill innocent people With chemical warfare they created crack and AIDS got the public thinking these were things that black folks made And every time there's violence shown in the media usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice TV and the news for years they have fed you this foolish notion that blacks are all criminals violent, low lifes, and then even animals I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me but I must do my part to combat the conspiracy The S.A.T. is not geared for the lower class so why waste time even trying to pass The educational system presumes you to fail the next place is the corner then after that jail You've got to understand that this has all been conspired to put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired It even exists when you go to your church cuz up on the wall a white Jesus lurks They use your subconscious to control your will they've done it for a while and developed the skill to make you want to kill your own brother man black against black you see it's part of their plan They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap what they really want to do is get rid of us blacks Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me you must be aware to combat the conspiracy Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold now that rap is big business the snakes got bold They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop cuz they have no regard for real hip-hop They'll compare you to others and say: "but yo, he sells" and you know in your heart that he's weak as hell So you say: "I ain't doing that corny stuff" but they tell ya that your chart positions will go up Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises and when they break 'em then your mama says "Son you're making records but that guy seems shady" it could be too late and your career could be played gee I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see we all have a job to combat the conspiracy The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: GangStarr Album: Daily operation Song: The Illest Brother Typed by: mrmaj@juno.com (from liner notes) Chorus: Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect It takes the illest brother just to get respect Got to be the illest brother when it's time to get wreck Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check I'm one of the illest brothers known to man but if you don't understand, see I'm a grown man And I stand 5'8" and 3 quarters giving orders to my sqaudron cuz I'm like the sergeant  or general but let me keep this minimal I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns and like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought remembering the brothers who are gone now I will make a strong vow to make things right ignite the mic, get hype and all that Suckers try to menace but they always fall flat to the ground as I astound come around I'll put you down about the brothers who think they're the boss think they're getting large but in the end they pay the cost Of their lives and that ain't the way to go out even take their boys with 'em cause they know their boys will go out But when it comes to facing some time they're like crying like weeping, wanna call mom Dukes But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did she knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids But who's to judge when you're trying to survive the one who moves first might be the one to stay alive So when you think you're hard and dominating the set just remember the illest brother claims respect! Like I said I'm an ill kid, so never dare test me they wanna arrest me cuz i'm causing a frenzy Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go real gangsters chill cuz real gangsters know That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low cuz too much talk will get you beef on the street And brothers in the city have to live this way it may cause dismay but Imma' tell it anyway Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression An example of hard times cuz to make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb But even if you change and come right and exact there's another brother scheming so just watch your back I know a brother who thought he had it all but little did he know he was bound for a down fall He'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody he wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody Cuz if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot there'd be no hesitation he'd just shoot It's like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly except it's reality and you don't see it on TV Brothers keep dying in the streets cuz the streets are designed  to keep you from having peace of mind I know an old man, he's got a rifle to stifle  any young punk, he hides it under his bunk And I know a kid who's been to jail and he told me that the system had failed him So now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids and the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs But you gotta check the move cuz there's a reason a method to the madness and you know what I'm meaning Cuz rather than being the herb, vic, or chump you can be just like my man cold holding the pump But living like that you take a chance with your life but some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight I'm like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools all fakes, all snakes and ones who try to break the rules and regulations Stipulations made by the GangStarr you try to flex muscle but you know you can't hang ha You're making me vexed but yeah you can go next just remember the illest brother claims respect Chorus repeat Yo money don't front you know you blew your chance and now it's my turn so Imma' take command Cuz I'm like the one who's got all the juice I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew Very easily I got more ammo I'm like the ill kid the psycho man yo Cuz now I'm past the point and I ain't gonna return and when it comes to your destruction I ain't really concerned About the consequences cuz I'm living day to day So who are you to comment about me and my ways. I get my attitude from living and I never forget You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!

The kid was nervous and flinching And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin Closer and closer, put the gun to his head Shorty was down to catch a body instead Money was scared so he panicked Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic  But shorty said, "Now" pulled the trigger and stepped It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger Rolling with troops of his sons like a gansta figure He's near the peak of his crazy career His posse's a nightmare, mack and jewels and crazy gear But as we know, the things we do come back And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract 'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it You know the rest, so don't front, the plan has been upset Some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep Artist: Gangstarr (feat.

was long I was bobbing my head cuz the music was on I turned it down then I peeped to my right I saw this kid and his girl having a fight Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face and then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews started buck wiling tryna' snatch kids jewels After that 50 came and turned the party out and then the ambulance came to take the body out And we didn't even get all the equipment out and we didn't even get to turn the place out This can happen often and it's really fucked up So I'll ask you to

Degrading things like cleaning up people's vomit For a little bit of dough, and plus your brain gets nothing from it I'm smarter than that this girl thinks to herself I'm worth more than that, she thinks to herself She pours a drink for herself while she stares out the window This guy says he got work for her, maybe she should go to him yo The money's good, and plus he'll dress her up nice She left her baby's daddy cuz he beat her up twice She don't really like sex But she hates welfare checks And where there's money, that's where she thinks there's respect And what's this girl's purpose?

A brother gotta eat, plus all the Henny and all the smoke is gone All it takes is one quick stick Gotta fill his belly now, which vic should he pick? He does his dirt all by his lonely, forget his homies He doesn't fell like splitting any loot, them suckas be acting phony So much potential but all gone to waste Now he lurks in night, with a loaded gun on his waist Too late for this lost soul, his life's in a chokehold Mentality is weak, and doing crime is all he knows Never caring who he hurts, as long as he's taking money Forget an education, and legal ways of making money And what's this kid's purpose? Will he self-destruct? When a brother's about to go down, who's there to help him up? (Les Nubians singing Chorus) [Guru] Who's there for my people on the streets? (Who's there? Who's there?)

True players always maintaing, I'm different I told ya Don't want to be just a commodity I'm smarter G This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me It's the truest part of me Fans now mobbing me Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery Back then I guess it was hard to see The real paradox What an artist see It's like that saying Be careful what you pray for you might get it  Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em Rain one day sunshine the next Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed What's next accounted by the press Mad stress on my chest  Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test On "Any Given Sunday" I got to play my best Chorus: Sacrifice don't give up the fight,  everything will be all right on any given Sunday Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall Depends on you if you win or lose,  you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe [Jamie Foxx] On the battlefields left abandoned One man standing To me the ball was handed Taken shots and left stranded, No defensive they tackle me Every blow brings back a memory Learning lessons from my injury It's killing me  Cause at first they wasn't feeling me Never given a chance to show my true ability Too many pressures trying to play me out Put me positions that's sure to lay me out No doubt Chorus: Sacrifice don't give up the fight,  everything will be all right on any given Sunday Guru:

for what you believe [Common] Playing on a field of hard times These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from Nowhere is where I came from From day one, I knew the game and how to play run But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons Now I learn from self when pain comes And walk when they say run Fame can be as painful as Death of patron Young black, gifted But I'm rapped in myself Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself See what happens with wealth At times you can lose yourself During the sunniest of days many superstars fell From cotton to football fields You know how they play brothers As long as we play well they love us I know that on Any Given Sunday This can be taken from me But it all comes down to is money I know that on Any Given Sunday  This can be taken from me  But it all comes down to is money y'all Chorus: (2x) Sacrifice don't give up the fight,  everything will be all right on Any Given Sunday Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the

Rough and durable fit for any weather See it's not me to sound mediocre Picture the Guru comin' off like a joker No instead i'll smoke ya Light me like fireworks city dweller The streets is where I lurk and I don't sweat the limelight My folks know I'm hype and sucka rappers need to rhyme right So you can call me the equalizer with my elite speech You'll all know I'm wiser Some emcees are fads and that's a drag But I'm genuine and DJ Krush is a b-boy mastamind B-boy mastamind, one of the greatest of all time Truly the game never lame or mundane It's a shame the way some do rap With the mad corny tracks and the lines that are wack But beware cause I'm here to testify Lit up against me even the best'll fry You know not fish or chicken til they get nice and crisp And learn respect or then i'll have to dismiss 'em Which one'll be next to meet the slayer Yes the payer of dues the super cool rhymesayer You gets no wins You get dropped like bowling pins I wonder but look how deep you're in Now there's no turnin' back You better come attack Quit the phony crap or I'ma flip like billy jack I use my mic like a bat or a stick And bash every single emcee that's counterfeit You can fool some people some of the time But who you trying to kid with those played out rhymes This ain't no joke, it's an art And punk rappers fake hard when they got no heart But a true b-boy knows the real stuff I don't have to fantasize and tell lies to feel tough I got more rhymes than new york's got crimes Why, cause I'm a b-boy mastamind My styles universal In a battle, i'd hurt you You ain't got enough skills to even enter my circle You can try to compete but if the flow is weak You'll end up on the floor flat out on the concrete I never ever thought about losin' Cause chumps I'm abusin', and microphones I'm bruisin' I get charged, I done leavin' rappers scarred Suckas should be barred, yo I'm pullin their cards I'm sick and tired of these copycat rap acts Bitin' concepts and frontin with knapsacks that's wack Because they know they aren't fly After this year, kiss their careers goodbye And I will remain being real  Cause when I rock, I got more strength than Seal Feel the pressure that I release It's kind of like the gunpowder in my piece Ya beggin me and Krush to spare ya Cause we take mad respect when we're in your area And you know we won't be lettin' up And after we hit ya, yo you won't be gettin up I'm wettin up, each and every sucka crew Chumps make one record then start to act new I'ma burn ya with a slower or faster rhyme You can't test a b-boy mastamind The Original
