He went to the store and he got the zags He came back walkin' with my homeboy Cash Sucka came over; he was lookin for a ride Runnin' from the police, he ain't have no place to hide A smile came on my face when I swallowed my beer I'm chillin' like a villian and I got no fear Now Tony Lane came; he said he was bored Eatin' on some chips that he got from the store I said I'm bored too, so what's up with that?

Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland...  Moving on to St. Louis, where thecountry is fucked With gold teeth int hey mouth, but they still know what's up Where it's hot as a motherfucker Hot enough to make ya cuss That's why I kept my ass on the bus But later on, whenit cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends Who put us up on the St. Louis cap The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich and a couple of bitches Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store He put me down with a herringbone and shoes galore That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home But then they had to prove me wrong Cuz later that night after we did the show We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin and shootin -- in Missouri? Damn, how could this happen? Now St. Louis...  Yeah y'all, St. Louis...  I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good They need to stop watchin that "Colors" and "Boyz in the Hood" Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw And never ever seen the Shaw But now, back to the story that I'm tellin We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits When I'm thinkin bout horse dookey and cowboy boots I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest And San Antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test And before it was over the shit got deep A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street Then they came in the club thinkin of scrappin Little did they know that we was packin Yeah, we was puttin em down and squaring the rest, shit I even had to wear the bulletproof vest Now San Antonio...  Yeah, San Antonio...  After a month on the road We came home and I can safely say That L.A. is a much better place to stay How could a bunch of niggaz in a town like this Have such a big influence on niggaz so far away? But still my story ain't over cuz I got one more to tell And the people of Colorado, they know it well It was all in the news and if you don't remember I had this show I did in Denver With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink Bitches was loving it, but niggaz was shovin and shit To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my guests When it was over two niggaz needed stitches Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches Now Denver...  Yeah y'all, Denver...  And ya know that Oakland...  Yeah y'all St. Louis...  Uh-huh, San Antonio...  Yeah, and Denver...  I thought ya knew...

They got me waking up in the morning getting loaded Got me worrying so hard sometimes I'm feeling like my brain exploded But I'm a break it down, fix it and re-roll it And show you haters out here that I control it I'm in this for something so different that you couldn't imagine The style, the flyness, the beautiful hoes The pile, the higness, the pitiful lows That keeps a major player like me up on his toes No, not quite, I want my props on the merit of the hands That I use to mould myself to the spirit of a man I'm just a tiny grain of sand under my God The one who keeps me humble, keeps me up and working hard It's alright to be in love with yourself But when your sex life gets bad you ain't on the shelf Lose your addictions, clean spirit's a must Shed your inhibitions and come bounce with us We trying to have fun from Japan to Compton With no more evil cause it salts the program See I never went back to something that burned out And I ain't never did a party I ain't turn out [Chorus: Raphael Saadiq] Things I used to do, I don't do no more Places I used to go, don't move me like before Ahh, but it's gonna be rough [Mausberg] >From the bottom to the top, top to the bottom Real homeys don't forget about the ones who thought about em Rags to riches, riches to rags I apologize for hurting your feelings, little fag Back in the day we was young thinking everything was cool Ditching school, puffing beadies and drinking brew Afraid of the bomb izm but we tried it Ain't no sense in denying it, I loved that environment Take a look back and damn near shed a tear Reminiscing on the past time, year after year When we grew up, things have changed You in the penitentiary, I be dwelling in the rap game Started at the same path but I chose to go right Looking for money and fame cause I'm a rider for life And all the slanging and banging and fucking rats in the past I shook it to the left and I ain't looking for a pass [DJ Quik] Now I just want to do my best whether it's work, play or either And I ain't trying to be no preacher cause they ain't perfect neither One of the coldest entertainers that I done seen yet With the skill to rock the fellas and make the ladies sweat But there's a method to the madness that I suffer from Making the hardest dudes tremble and even tougher run It's called the spirit and it's fly, and it's making me bigger Keeping me from stressing out and throwing nuttys on niggas Ain't religion for me unless it's all to the good Cause I'm an open-minded ex-G with my sights on the hood Trying to keep the little YGs out of the line of the fire Even if it means I'm gonna take the hit, leak and expire Now I see what Top was saying before he left his hole That we'll shine like glitter, my nigga, but keep your soul Don't give another nigga control of your gold Share your parties with the world and watch you get swirled The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Quik f/ Suga Free Album: Balance and Options Song: Do I Love Her Typed by: yourgyrlzpause84@aol.com (DJ Quik) Lay there, please don't move baby. on me, don't you stop.

I throw these two back, you throw me two more, they're so cheap I couldn't get the winning hand that I wanted in my sleep Cause when the dream get good, I get trampled by sheep Nightmares, even when I'm walkin in day I'm havin dreams that I'm runnin but there's smoke in the way And there's this man in a suit, he take a toke and he say, "You have a promise that you made and you broke it today." Now which part of this movie here did I just miss? Did I really sell my soul to this big red bitch? I don't think what you got to offer is really enough For cars sex and houses, money and stuff I'd rather be broke and own nothin but piece of mind and a Benz, and a house, and a nine-deuce-nine on top, help me out before I sink the boat There's gotta be more than 50 ways to keep afloat Cause I feel like I'm suffocatin, I can't breathe I wanna go, but I'm too afraid to leave Take me with you Mausie, I know you're seein somethin grand as you fade away, and you gently release my hand And it shook my balance, cause you ain't no more alive You think I'd see you, if I chewed this 45? Oh I'd be the first person poppin three, droppin me to the abyss, but I miss, what's stoppin me? I got the pressures of the WORLD on my little back My nerves are turnin into jelly and I'm bout to crack You think I'm cheatin on my homies, by holdin back? No I really protect them all because the truth is wack Forever bars and forever scars Bein trapped and dyin young makes forever stars Tell me why am I so hesitant? And the way life's goin, looks like when hell comes, I'ma be a resident [Chorus 2X: Wanya Morris] La, la la-la - la, la la-la La, la la-la - la, la la-la [DJ Quik] They tell me Quik, suck it up, I'm supposed to But me and Mausberg was closer than most knew It ain't dramatized, and it ain't a fuckin act when you're traumatized, and it ain't no turnin back When you're so connected, and it's hard to keep your focus When you're so affected, and it's hard to love again When you're so neglected - suck it up, I'm 'posed to That ain't easy for somebody you're close to, shit See your homey in a coffin is so wicked and vivid It's gon' be harder on all of us, cause we gon' relive it Over and over, drunk or sober, from October to October I steadily feel like I'm gettin knocked over And all the money in the world, don't make it better And a whole bottle of alcohol, don't make it wetter With a blur and a slur I'm still callin ya name And on top of this drama you add fame? Wild But when you start to bubble then your friends they spite you And if you go to church, then hip-hop won't like you I feel like a giant on a worldwide stage but at the same time trapped in a real tight cage With no way out, I play out, then I come back Cause there's an unwritten law that says I can't be wack So I put on my game face, go back to the same place Only to realize that y'all ain't got the same taste Even with somethin new, they look at you cold And without a hot face, consider you old And leavin me stressed and broken-hearted How could I be finished with West coast rap?

Moving on to St. Louis, where they thinki they be buffin with gold teeth in they mouth but they still know whassup And the summer is kinda hot Hot enough to make ya cuss And that's why I stayed on the bus But later on when it cooled off we came down and made a couple of friends Who put us up on the St. Louis cap The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich and a couple of hoochies Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store He put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home But then they had to prove me wrong Cuz later that night after we did the show We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin and shootin -- in Missouri?

Yeah, San Antonio...  After a month on the road We came home and I can safely say That L.A. is a much better place to stay How could a bunch of suckers in a town like this Have such a big influence on brothers so far away?
