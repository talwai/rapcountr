Typed by: jdjong@worldonline.nl Snoop (Daz): Yeah, what I'ma do right here is take my time, and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace, and my niggas behind the wall. See you when I get there, you know what I'm saying? (really doe) So drip with me as I go down memory lane. Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener, (1-8-7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, ('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). I bring you the motherfucking .38, (just get the MC and the homie Nate). So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). Nate (Daz): Do you remember back on the East Side? Where all us niggas used to love to ride. We didn't care what we did, time was nothing to us we were just kids. Times are different now, but you still get stuck, I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. Snoop: Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, June 17th, 1979. That's my first time being arrested, I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit.  I learned than from the G's, a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, she said: "playing football should be your only fun son". I'm like "allright" so we enter the house, come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, I looked at my momma and said: "damn, why you snitch?" They put me on punishment but that didn't work, now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. Nate: My homie told me one day he had a jack move, he said: "come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth". I agreed and said "come on, let's go and jack them fools", next day we were draped in the county blues. I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), saying to myself "I'll never fuck with that nigga again". 'fore I'm locked down I learned to be what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. Original gangsta Daz: I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, to let you know we can't take no more. Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, and ask myself: "who the fuck should I really fear?". I ran around with the best killers, thug criminals and drug dealers. Blasting niggas if they come near us, (???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. Knock on wood for good luck, serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. Nate (Daz): Original gangsta (original gangsta), coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). Coming from the East Side... You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, C-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, shout outs to my niggas C, Style and me. Snoop (Nate): Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) You trick ass bitch!

[Intro] Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse [Eminem] Till I collapse I'm spillin these raps long as you feel 'em Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin 'em Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin 'em and I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin 'em Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hoch venom Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop Amoxacillin's just not real enough The criminal cop killin hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up? Fo' shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck [Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit, till my bones collapse [Eminem] Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin you get when you real and you spit an' people are feelin your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend tryin to hold on to it cause you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a LOT of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does NOT offend me That's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin me Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me You hate it but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me [Eminem] Soon as the verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart What is he thinkin? How not to go against me, smart! And it's absurd, how people hang on ev-ery word I'll probably NEVER get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together ev-ery verse My thoughts, are sporadic, I act, like I'm a addict I rap, like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin at 'em The track is on some battlin raps who want some static? Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is WACK if I'm not the baddest, so [Eminem] Until the roof [N.Dogg] Until the roof [Eminem] The roof comes off [N.Dogg] The roof comes off [Eminem] Until my legs [N.Dogg] Until my legs [Em + N] Give out from under me [Eminem] I will not fall, I will stand tall [Eminem] Feels like no one can beat me The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Eve f/ Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg Album: Eve-olution Song: Hey Y'all Typed by: Doggfather323@cs.com * * send corrections to the typist Yea Yea, Evie Eve And you know, you better know [Snoop Dogg] I keep some chuck's on my feet khakis on my legs Trunk full of funk nigga while im breaking bread Sliding through your system banging, bobbing heads Doing mines and I don't care what other niggaz saying They can pop it, but they can't stop it, boy I'm getting mine Selling clothes up in this bitch like Calvin Klein Getting cuties to shake they booty at the same time I'd be damned If I go back to jail for the same crime I'm to slick to get caught up in this dirty game I'm a scollar that make dollaz off the birdy game Crip hoping I got it popping on the Blvd. Man I ain't fucking with chevy's I got my own car D-O Double you don't wanna rumble, why you testing me Oh I know, you must be gone off them extacy Bad habits you better kick it before it get you loc And try to get yourself hooked on this chronic smoke Fo' sho!!

"Yeah... uh huh..." [Verse 1] I'm caught up inside a tornado and sucked in By a rainstorm holding a hairdryer that's plugged in Somewhere between the Renaissance Center and 8 Mile Inside the Rock City that has spawned a unique child And lightening strikes twice I was hit when they birthed me And now I gotta live with this mouth that they cursed me They said I gotta use it with tracks and try to fuse it Don't abuse it and don't ever let 'em crack on your music So I sit and watch the people that do it and don't pursue it And instead I jot a little bit down then go review it I just wait until I'm ready to leap and jump into it Until I feel a little more confident I can do it Not so many years later I've waited and now I'm here To release a masterpiece on everybody in fear I ain't holding nothing back in a world that's full of evil My words can only injure or hurt so many people I'm here to trade spaces shatter and blade faces With guitars and bass lines and embrace and break stages The pain'll come in phases for now it's just outrageous When I'm knocking hear me cocking my gauge cause I'm impatient From the Motor City...

Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war Curiosity killed the cat, why I'm Curious George? Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz And just cause somethin looks good don't really mean that it is Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife And take the necessary steps to try to change my life I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good? [Ludacris] Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin Dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now Can't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12 Tryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell But yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that Continue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush Come on [Ludacris] No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart We all make mistakes, it's all good Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits Livin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it And learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice Just admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours There's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by That's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky Never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close Meanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows I've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul Just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow Come on [Chorus] - to fade w/ ad libs The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Mack 10 f/ Nate Dogg Album: Hustlas Handbook Song: Like This Typed by: Gitdafukup@yahoo.com [Mack 10] Am I a hustla?
