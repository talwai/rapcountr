ones need to huddle You bitch-ass individuals can call your girls and cuddle The times are gettin serious, critical and furious Heads are flyin everywhere but I remain oblivious Through it all, I got a wall, in front of me Above me, below me, you're actin like you know me But you don't and you never will, experience the thrill of what it's like to be alive, not real you are contrived I'm tryin to tell you, somethin, but all you know is nothin Breakin down MC's just like a sport similar to huntin First I see you grazin, I lock on with my eye Your life expectancy becomes identical with a fly Your destiny is sealed sonny, it was written long ago MC gets shot on stage while his mother watch the show My beats are brewed fresh daily, from the comforts of my home Just like the morning paper I'm on time like metronomes Season of the spider, everyone's a fighter I could burn your house with a 99 cent lighter Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter {*scratch: "I am a simple soul"*} [Verse Two] My style ain't obvious, mysterious and low Wets leave you wet due to miscellaneous flows I'm now transcendental, over instrumentals It's not accidental when I'm freakin wit'cha mental The rap phenomenon and gravitational breaker Gobble circuits and cities my whole committee will take a- -part your whole foundation 3 degrees of seperation Head body and limbs all placed in seperate nations Ain't nuttin common about this cause it ain't thinkable Ain't no prints visible when I display lyrical Cause it's all in the way I serenade I feast on booty niggaz who flayed Cause the back of all layin individuals not up to par My technique will sweep in and rock the Casbah It's like that sonny, I rock like stone Your oral synthetic and fake like silicon [Verse Three] Yo I hear someone's comin, he's bringin you a clue The dopest things in life are guaranteed to be taboo The trees are talking to me now and tellin me to turn the page Forget about the old and what could end the brand new age Cause the rules do not apply, and not too much is fair You either got the cash or you're entangled in the snare Called the world, wide web in the season of the spider Complex and combustible just like a dirt cheap lighter From Mariana Trench up to the tops of Everest The Blood is international, headquarters in the West Before you come to capture me I book like Deuteronomy I wake up in the morning way before the revelie And then I grab the microphone, sing a song of sorrow Got some dope-ass books if you want to you could borrow You better bring 'em back, my property don't disrespect You conversate with me you conversate with the adept [scratched samples] I am a simple soul As a soldier I take things simply [long instrumental pause] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to
