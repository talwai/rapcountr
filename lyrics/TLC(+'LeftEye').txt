No, part of my need is a company So I can hire out my own people to live out their own dreams So tell me, what's happenin to all yall people with low self esteem What, what, what, you want me to cry on your shoulder So you can turn around and laugh and talk about it when it's over? [Chorus: Left Eye] Me I believe in me Cause I take care of me Took so long to see All I really need is me Faith and family Finally made me see No matter what I think All I need is me [Verse 2: Left Eye] I ignored 30 mil, dates to making money When it got too convenient, I just gave it up I don't need the stress, I don't need the pain I do need the checks, but don't need the game Oh my how could him and I, be the same When the house burnt down, only I took the blame When the money ain't got funny, I predicted court What most of yall dwell, wouldn't even thought When the group had issues, I layed in the thought I corrected the bad news, I heard in intervers Tell me do you really know lisa, not many It's not contrary to fear, I don't know you either I'm more responsible for more, than you will ever see So many things you don't know, happen because of me I'm black to the design, to the state, that was me So how may of y'all will laugh at me [Chorus: Left Eye] Me I believe in me Cause I take care of me Took so long to see All I really need is me Faith and family Finally made me see No matter what I think All I need is me [Verse 3: Left Eye] Everybody says all they want the truth Well the truth is that I still got love for my group But you don't really want the truth when it's concerning you You want to hear that no one is doing better than you You love to hear the pain, you love to hear the struggle You love to know that paradise, has got trouble The only trouble we ever had is you being around Do not get involved, where you do not belong When my faith started to waver, I feltwas like I was done I felt like Brian McKnight, I was back at one The only one that was, the only one and ever The only one I need, the one and only me Because if I ever told you it was all on a different plane You would think that I meant our flights ain't the same My my crime is that I was so blind Didn't know I had everything that I wanted all the time [Chorus: Left Eye 4x] Me I believe in me Cause I take care of me Took so long to see All I really need is me Faith and family Finally made me see No matter what I think All I need is me The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes f/ Andre Rison Album: Supernova Song: Rags to Riches Typed by: jaxxbase@prodigy.net.mx A quick story from rags to riches Comin' to you from Supernova (AKA Left Eye) Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em (ha ha) I'm goin', I'm goin' from rags to riches (ha ha ha ha) I'm goin', I'm goin' from rags to riches (ha ha ha ha) I started off as an army brat (Atten-hut!)

But to swallow my pride to love and let loose of this feelin' inside Said if you want it that bad then you should have it And then he smiled and said I want you to grab it True confessions of a broken heart I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart Everybody's got a story About how they lost their one and only True confessions of a broken heart I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart Everybody's got a story About how they lost their one and only I'm on the hunt to get my nigga what he wants From back to front of the club She's tryin' to pull a stunt Even though they got the lights down low I can see the whole dance floor She must have slipped out the back door Rather than goin' back empty handed I know this ain't the way he planned it I do as if commanded Hmm let's see who next be the finest Who next be the best for sex And messin' with his Highness So I took another look and guess who's back I'm off the hook It's the lady in black Excuse me Miss, see that man sittin' at the table He wants to know If you're ready willin' and able So she followed me and obviously My man is gonna want a little privacy but I was wrong He turned it up another notch Asked if she went tongue to crotch And said he wants to watch True confessions of a broken heart I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart Everybody's got a story About how they lost their one and only True confessions of a broken heart I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart Everybody's got a story About how they lost their one and only So now I'm thinkin' what have I done and gotten' into? Maybe this will be strong and maybe monumental As I look in her eyes what is she gonna say? Never thought I'd be in dismay when I woke up today She said her thing ain't girls we in three different worlds So he mentioned instead that he wanted some head She obliged no menage then fled We were straight for 'bout a month Until pure lust were the topics we discussed Though I didn't mind he wants it all the time More women and all I've been in Spreadin' venom and still wanna be mine So I told him one day can't do it any more He reacts so relaxed Said he's done with them for sure Then I caught him one weekend Cheatin' and creepin' duct's leakin' don't speak I'll be leavin' True confessions of a broken heart I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart Everybody's got a story About how they lost their one and only True confessions of a broken heart I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart Everybody's got a story About how they lost their one and only The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes f/ 2pac Album: Supernova Song: Untouchable Typed by: killuminati@mixmail.com (Lisa)    Untouchable, look at how you found me I'm lookin' around sayin' these are my friends It's a strange world my enemies are my friends More of the same street, same world, same problems Is this indifferent?

In the mind  In the money In the face  In in the eyes In the days and the nights Well what is a friend Do you love it and leave it Again and again? Now our story begins Of two little friends You would've thought they were twins Would've thought they was kin Wouldn't think they could manage All the time they would spend For each other they'd fend For their friends till the end And their mothers know mothers Sisters know brothers Mothers know fathers Sons know their daughters Blood thicker than water If one had 50 cents They'd both have a quarter It only makes sense That destined love was in order They grew up together From pre-K to high school Winters in the snow Summers in the pool He's an athlete She's an actress But hormones would lead them to the mattress I thought you were my friend (friend) Together through thick and thin (friend) Like it we were All the things that we've been through I put so much trust in you  Back then (friend) Now what kind of friend Could you have been Not furious just curious She saw himself fit Who better than a boy  The girl grew up with How 'bout all the walks in the park On the phone all night Dreams like that she saw in plain sight To his friends he's urgin' The simple fact she's a virgin To her he'll be urgin' Sexually lets merge As you can see There's two different dreams Her thoughts are so pure His low as the floor She's lookin' He's gawkin' They're walkin' and talkin' About a new stage and phase That they should embark in So it came to that night No dinner no candlelight The female exhales Somethin' doesn't feel right She said it polite Honey please not tonight He didn't get in it So he got real malignant He hit her It hurt Her breath got suspended Then he looked at his work Not feelin' so splendid Their meeting had ended Feelin' offended He went and attended A counselin' session Now life is a lesson Full of questions Why we drown down Rather than manifestin' Went to his friend Right from the beginnin' With tears in his eyes Said I apologize She much obliged Made amends Once again They're friends to the end Yeah it was true love again As transparent as lens As apparent as kin What defines a friend Where does it lie In the mind In the money In the face In the eyes In the days and the nights What is a friend Do you love and leave it Again and again In the time In the sadness In the hurt In the pride It's the person dispersin' Through the hands of time Oh Oh oh I thought you were my friend What kind of friend?

All she was thinkin' "Why me?" and "Will it stop?" It's a damn shame Chorus: Damn shame That someone That someone would want to mess with you And you just can't get them out your mind Try to replace bad times with smiles Let it out Out right now I know it's hard to talk about You gotta keep going on with your life Letting it out Don't you let it back away The school bell rung For the first hour of school Her teacher called her moms Cuz she thinks she's skippin' school But if only they knew What was really goin' on She's cryin' for your help While y'all talkin' on the phone The teacher's on the wrong subject Sayin' that she think she grown Somebody call the police Damn callin' up Tyrone So her mother filed a report on her own This is the description that she gave what was known Fifteen She was last seen  Standin' on the corner Eatin' ice cream At the bus stop On 10th Street and Milly Ave. Just a few feet  From the spot Where she stayed Cute mini skirt And french braids Hundred-ten pounds What she weighed 5 foot 2 Eyes blue-grey Chorus Now back to the abandoned spot Where she's tryin' to pick the lock So he threw her in his 'lac Ridin' with the doors locked Drove her through the woods That was right around the block Dropped her off at the hospital In the parking lot The school bell rung For the end of a class At the same time She was runnin' in the flash To go and call her mother But her mother isn't there And when she finally seen her Speculation filled the air Her momma don't believe her She's keeps callin' her tricks and whores Sayin' I told you 'bout them older men before Her father didn't neither Afraid to face the sticks and stones And now she's searchin' for the grace to carry on It's a damn shame Chorus Let it go  Let it go I know it's hard But you should let it go Life goes on and you should know If you let it go Let it go Let it go  You should let it go I know you'll make it If you let it go Life goes on and you should know Let it go Let it go Let it go  Let it go I know it's hard But you should let it go Life goes on and you should know If you let it go Let it go The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: TLC Album: 3D Song: Quickie Typed by: Unrestricted4786@msn.com * * send corrections to the typist Ladies and Gentlemen!

I no longer hear from  Could it be the unknown  Sneaking into my zone  Off we roam  My spirituals is not alone I'm visualizing this invisible clone  It's my own  And it's own  Rest assured it's my dome  Maybe I need to go to bed  Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head  Nots while I raps  When it hits me (ha ha ha ha....)  But now it's laughin at me Yo, what the hell is happenin?

Come on, come on Nothing ventured, nothing gained You are the one The lonely heart that can't be tamed Come on, come on I'm hoping that you feel the same This is something that I can't forget I thought that we would just be friends Things will never be the same again It's just the beginning it's not the end Things will never be the same again It's not a secret anymore Now you've opened up the door Starting tonight and from now on We'll never, never be the same (uh, never be the same again) Never be the same again (uh, never be the same again, come on) Now I know that we were close before (before) I'm glad I realised I need you so much more (yeah) And I don't care what anyone will say (uh, ha) It's about you and me (you and me) And we'll never be the same again (uh) I thought that we would just be friends (ohh yeah) Things will never be the same again (things will never be the same again) It's just the beginning it's not the end (we've only just begun) Things will never be the same again It's not a secret anymore Now we've opened up the door Starting tonight and from now on We'll never, never be the same (never be the same again) aha Never be the same again (uh, never be the same again) (aha) Uh, check it Night and day Black beach sand to red clay The US to UK NYC to LA From sidewalks to highways See it will never be the same, what I'm saying My mindframe never changed so you can't rearrange But sometimes it seems completely forbidden To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden When there's no competition And you render my condition Though improbable it's not impossible For a love that could be unstoppable, but wait Fine lines between fate and destiny Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be? When you tell me the stories of your quest for me Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly And as our energies mix and begin to multiply Everyday situations they start to simplify So things will never be the same between you and I We intertwine our life forces Are not what you'll find (yeah) I thought that we would just be friends (come on) Things will never be the same again It's just the beginning it's not the end (ooh) Things will never be the same again It's not a secret anymore (uh) Now you've opened up the door (yeah) Starting tonight and from now on (yeah) We'll never, never be the same (Come on) hooo hooooo Things will never be the same again (yeah) Aha (uh) never be the same again The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott f/ TLC Album: Under Construction Song: Can You Hear Me Typed by: the_r_com@hotmail.com [Intro: Ms. Haugton phone call] I been checkin' on your moms and dad (uh) And your brother since the day you left (left) Passed on and went away with God (uh) But for your momma its been so damn hard  I hate to even hear her cry (cry) Aaliyah she asked me why (why) Would her baby girl go this way (oh) Can you give me better words to say  Come one day she'll see you again  With the same ol' beatiful smile  Long hair and the voice of a hummin' bird You'll be singing them same ol' songs  Aaliyah can you hear me  I hope that you're proud of me  Me and Tim we been doin' our thing But its never been the same since you had to go I ain't never met a friend more incredible  Ohhh...

How many niggas do you know get two Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do Keep your enemies close, where they can see you It's not your enemy who get you It's always your own people It's always your own people It's always your own people It's always your own people It's always your own people [Chorus: Tanya Herron] Mass confusion, in my head Killing me, driving me mad Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
