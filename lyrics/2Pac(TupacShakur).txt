But when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet I couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher? But that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!! (2Pac) Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from A dream girl to many brothers, but true to none Her reputation was enormous - a real go getter And once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her Maybe it was her smile, her personality or the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore But whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert Real heart-breaker, but never get hurt She had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond helpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin' Met with Politicians, peace to many others Suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers She took the power that they possessed And Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed Minnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her But he wanted payment for the things he did for her He grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand Minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand She was a legend to everyone who knew her That's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher (Ray Tyson) Minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler Addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker He took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown He bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds She was an addict, tired of the static and poverty Sick of the same ghetto misery See, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement Smokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement Then one day their relationship stopped when Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops Minnie was hurt, lost without a clue To her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new So she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems She cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams (Ray Tyson) She had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden He gave her things that this girl was much needin' A plush house made of gold and steel A diamond car with a platt in the wheel Now you might think this is a lot of stuff But to Minnie this was not enough He bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses His meal she ate was a dozen courses She had a fortune in nickels and dimes And she sat around and counted it a billion times She had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin' Had every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN'!! She would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye Then she dissin', with zero reply The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Tupac Shakur Album: The Lost Tapes Song: The Case of the Misplaced Mic II Typed by: Do4LoveMakaveli@aol.com * * send corrections to the typist Verse 1 - 2pac (DJ Bizzy) They finally did it (whats that?)

It's a shame because the man's slain He got caught in the chains of his own game How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me Sweated me, hunted me Trapped in my own community One day I'm gonna bust Blow up on this society Why did ya lie to me?

Back in the days we played practical jokes on everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on All through high school, girls by the dozens Sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't But like the old saying goes Time goes on, and everybody grows Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways You chose the dope gaaaame, my microphone pays In many ways we were paid in the old days So far away from the crazies with AK's And though I been around clowning with the Underground I'm still down with my homies from the hometown And if you need, need anything at all I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call [Verse Two] It's a shame, you chose the dope game Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine You got fame now you run with no shame I chose rap, tracks to make stacks In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats But now I don't wanna down my homie No matter how low you go you're not lowly And I, hear that you made a few enemies But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance I'll be there in an instant Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover I'd be no different than the others H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E I'm down to the E-N-D Cause it's a fall in no time at all I'm down for y'all, when my homies call Word, if my homies call [Verse Three] Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin kinda swell now But I hear that you're going through some hell pal But life makin records ain't easy It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy But I guess that the streets is harder Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather My homies is making it elsewhere Striving, working nine to five with no health care We both had dreams of being great But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make To be great, I'm giving it all it takes Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes I gotta take, my place or fall from grace The foolish way, the pace is quick and great Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate But my homie would never do me wrong That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on No matter who the foe they must fall Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: 2Pac Album: 2Pacalypse Now Song: Brenda's Got a Baby Typed by: OHHLA.com Brenda's got a Baby Brenda's got a Baby I hear Brenda's got a baby Well, Brenda's barely got a brain A damn shame Tha girl can hardly spell her name (That's not her problem, that's up to Brenda's family) Well let me show ya how it affects the whole community Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a junky puttin death into his arm It's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know Just cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation Brenda got herself a boyfriend Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch the joy end She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she Went out and had a church of kids As long as when tha check came they got first dibs Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure She's 12 years old and she's having a baby In love with a molester who's sexing her crazy And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together, whatever He left her and she had tha baby solo She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so She didn't know, what ta throw away and what to keep She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries She didn't realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes Now tha babys in the trash heep balling Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling Brenda wants ta run away, momma say, you makin' me lose pay The social workers here everyday Now Brenda's gotta make her own way Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby Baaaaaaaaby (don't you know she's got a baby) (don't you know she's got a baby) (don't you know she's got a baby) (don't you know she's

I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies, that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up [Chorus - repeat 2X] Keep ya head up, oooo child things are gonna get easier ooooo child things are gonna get brighter [Verse Two] Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two And I realize momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life, to raise me right And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems tha rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up You know it's funny when it rains it pours They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is it ain't no hope for tha future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup And even though you're fed up Huh, ya got to keep your head up [Verse Three] And uhh To all the ladies havin babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless While tears, is rollin down your cheeks Ya steady hopin things don't all down this week Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me I was given this world I didn't make it And now my son's getten older and older and cold From havin the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is drivin Benz I'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but please... you got to keep your head up The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: 2Pac Album: Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.

[2Pac] Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night Please send me a pops before puberty the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity Moms always work, I barely see her I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her It's a wonder they don't understand kids today so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way And I hope that he answers me I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family A different father every weekend Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends I'm gettin sick of all the friendships As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick How can I be a man if there's no role model? Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle I'm so sorry...

(Tupac) I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block. Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks. And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked. And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted. I put the nigga in his casket, Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic. I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.  I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce. And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hos. Got a 45 screamin' about survival. Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo. Hollar "one-time" when I say so. Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences. Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches. And they say how do you survive weighin' 165 In a city where the skinny niggas die? Tell Mama don't cry. Even when they kill me, They can never take the game from a young G. I'm st8 ballin'! St8 ballin'! Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin' pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it. But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'. It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'. Dressin' down like a villian', but only on the block. It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops. Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends. I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz. I hate to stip let my music bump, Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck. Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo. A need money in a major way. Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH!! Hey!, and getten' paid You other mothafuckas callin', But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas, We st8 ballin'!! St8 ballin'! Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do. So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP! But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes Young nigga time to do or die. I keep a pistol in my pocket, Ready on my block. Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit. And now they see that mothafucka beat pain, At point blank range cause he slept on the game. Ain't a damned thing changed Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em, If you can't stand pain better hold 'em. Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll. You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga. Better live your life to the fullest, You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it. Cause even when they kill me,  they can never take the game from a young G. We st8 ballin'! We st8 ballin'! To my niggas in the penitentiary, Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me. Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born, And once again it's on,  I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone. Who the hell can you get to stop me? I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse. I keep my glock cocked I need it cause they're all shady. I finally made it  now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me! I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back. I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack. And I came up a long way from food stamps. And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps. Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire. What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die. I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs. I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs. And mothafucka, we be ballin'! All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong! We st8 ballin'.

Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain Show me some happiness again, I'm goin blind I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin well I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?

Verse One: 2Pac Look here Miss Thang hate to salt your game but yous a money hungry woman and you need to change. In tha locker room all the homies do is laugh. High five's cuz anotha nigga  played your ass. It was said you were sleeezy even easy sleepin around for what  you need See it's your thang  and you can shake it how you wanna. Give it up free  or make your money on the corner. But don't be bad and play the game get mad and change. Then you wonda why these muthafuckas call you names. Still lookin' for a way out and that's OK  I can see you wanna stray there's a way out. Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school. And as the years pass by  you can show them fools. But you ain't tryin' to hear me cuz your stuck, you're headin' for the bathroom 'bout to get tossed up. Still lookin' for a rich man you dug a ditch, got your legs up tryin' to get rich. I love you like a sista  but you need to switch and that's why they called U bitch, I betcha. Chorus Verse Two: 2Pac You leave your kids with your mama cuz your headin' for the club in a skin tight miniskirt lookin' for some love. Got them legs wide open  while you're sittin' at the bar Talkin' to some nigga  'bout his car. I guess he said he  had a Lexxxus, what's next? You headin' to his car for some sex I pass by can't hold back tears inside cuz, lord knows for years I tried. And all the other people on my block hate your guts Then you wonda why they stare and call you slut. It's like your mind don't understand you don't have to kill your dreams ploten' schemes on a man Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'  I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch  and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha. Chorus Verse Three: 2Pac I guess times gettin' hard even harder for you cuz, hey now, got a baby on the way now More money from the county and thanks to the welfare you're about to get your hair done. Got a dinner date  can't be late trick or treat, sweet thang got anotha trick to meet. The way he did it it was smooth plottin' while he gamin' you So baby, peep tha rules. I shoulda seen it in the first case the worst case I shoulda never called you back  in the first place. I remember back in high school baby you was fast  straight sex and barely move your ass. But now things change cuz you don't look the same let the ghetto get the best of you baby, that's a shame Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased and finally be in peace. So where your niggas at now cuz everybody left they stepped  and left you on your own See I loved you like a sista but you died to quick And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha. Chorus Outro: 2Pac Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker keep stressen me fuckin' with a muthafucken mind I figured you wanted to know you know why we call them hos bitches and maybe this might help you understand it ain't personal strictly business baby strictly business So If you wonder why we call U bitch You wonder why we call U bitch If you wonder why we call U bitch You wonder why we call U bitch The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: 2Pac f/ Outlawz Album: All Eyez on Me Song: When We Ride Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash Outlaw Immortalz Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls They know You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch Picture if you will seven deadly human beings blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach each nigga on every street May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud of what transpired since the day the seed was planted The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit Just me and my dogs livin like hogs Outlaw Immortalz What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue What lies between is the fiction Don't fuck around and make it true [Tupac] Hahahahahaha My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me Plus my alias is Makaveli A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come [Hussein Fatal] They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table I'm robbin ya niggaz cradle wit a knife in your navel Rap-related criminally activated and evil I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin Desert Eagle Till the end, I'm tellin all friends and enemies You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast Young Gunz fire and niggaz bleed, I see Mo [Kastro] I be shinin like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin holdin pistols The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes and assholes who claim, like they be runnin thangs I be gunnin those same niggaz runnin late, to their fate [Napoleon] My alias is motherfuckin Na-poleon, and I'd rather be robbin again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin But the shit ain't nothin, and I got no time for no bluffin befo' a nigga finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin I think these niggaz got the game fucked up If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)

Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album; resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G., and several other New York rappers Jay-Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everbody wants to know is --  why'd they get this nigga started? Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment but released this statement: [Makaveli] It's not about East or West It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money,  riders and punks. Which side are you on? {*gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground*} These niggaz is still fuckin talkin? You niggaz still breathin?
