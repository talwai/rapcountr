They don't give a damn who gets killed Just as long as "the dice keep rollin The hoes keep hoein And the money keeps flowin") My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns  Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds On 139 and Lennox Ave. there's a big park And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax They're sneakier than alley cats That's why I carry gats Yo, I'm a muthafuckin fugitive Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live Because to me it's all about a buck I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck We stormed the city, shootin shit up like Frank Nitty We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50 One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash Then I murdered his ass and took his half Because I'm all about ends and skins When you got dough, you don't need no muthafuckin friends If I catch you on a late night, black, you're gettin stuck, jack My moms told me to get a job, fuck that Aiyo, picture me gettin a job Takin orders from Bob, sellin corn on the cob Yo, how the hell I'ma make ends meet Makin about 120 dollars a week? Man, I rather do another hit I want clean clothes, mean hoes, and all that other shit Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin canivin muthafucka Breakin in cribs with a crowbar I wasn't 'poor', I was po', I couldn't afford the 'o-r' I used to wait until it gets dark And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast I vicked this nigga named Eugene Took his brand new ring Cause stickin up's a everyday routine Once I was crusin in a beat-up ride Saw this nigga named Clyde And snuck up on him from the blind side I told him, "Give up the dough, before you get smoked Oh you're broke? ( *shots* ) now you're dead broke" The Big L was cold crazy A top-notch crook snatchin pocket books from old ladies I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck Even rob a Miller truck, cause I don't give a fuck Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim Once a brother done broke into my house and I robbed him Plenty and many brains I bust Cause I was livin the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous Word All of us from Harlem 139 That's livin the lifestyle of the poor & dangerous Uknowmsayin?

I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform One minute you're hardcore and raw That's what you was known for, but not no more You changed, you rearranged You're not the same, your raps are blame That explain why you lost your fame Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops You turned pop, now you no longer gain props Who's fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack So MC's, don't ever step out your range Remain the same  And only change with the time Unless you get dropped like a dime Go for yours like I'm goin for mine But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper And never try to look or even sound like another rapper Just fulfill your own needs  Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin beeds? I don't understand it (I don't understand it) I don't understand it (I don't understand it) I don't understand it (I don't understand it) How MC's take this rap game for granted [Verse 3] This is how it should be done I'm not the one, and my raps is strong like gum But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb Plus slum (How come?) Rap skills they have none And I wonder how the hell they records sell They raps are stale and frail They're forced like fairy tales Your technique and everything you speak's weak You got a little airplay because of your beats Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black Step to this and get ran over like train tracks Your raps border wack, and you went on tour with that  Crap, don't understand it, cause rhyme skills you lack I got more soul that Nike Airs, givin MC's nightmares Rappers be frontin hard, and rhymes they don't write theirs But still call themselves MC's  Please, how could that be?

It seems like my life's been cursed Ever since I was a child, and how will I make it? I won't, that's how I walk around with a frown; I got no reason to smile And how will I make it? I won't, that's how Aiiyyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul And how will I make it? I won't, that's how I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle And how will I make it? I won't, that's how [2nd Verse] Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15 No more fun and games, it's time to get cream (word up) Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed I went to church, prayed everyday And it still got worse Soon I ran into a couple of guns Started stalking the streets, slate robbing suckers for funds (give it up, give it up) Now everyday I creep with the heat Ain't nothing sweet, I rob for meat If I don't steal I don't eat Then I lost control and started going too far Robbed this brother named Umar Then got snatched by the blue car Where I grew up it was a living hell Then I started to realize  I'm better off in a prison cell Now I can sleep, now I can eat Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street Aiiyyo I just can't take it And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?' [3rd Verse] Doing time was full of stress G, all the Fighting's and stabbings and men finding men sexy One tried to test me didn't find it humorous Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish My time came to a cease; I'm back on the streets again I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again But it's getting crazy hectic Cause I'm broke, get up naked And can't get a job cause of my jail record Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups My whole life was deserted Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it? All I tried to do was live the one life that I got But it seems like I can't get a fair shot (word up) I just can't take it (uh-huh) And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'
