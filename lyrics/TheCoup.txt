B: No, this is it [Boots] Check it out, it's the motherfucking C-O-U To the P now you're fucking with the real dudes Who will meet you with a fleet of brothers in the street Getting drunk off liberation fuck the Hennessey Cause you calmly kept us down for far too long Now you're going up in smoke like Cheech and Chong And the song "I Ain't the Nigga" is the Constitution Niggers die but Africans make revolution So what happens when a people do not get their dues Well it's tried there's a riot so flip on the news And let's go reach the 98th here in Oaktown But let's just say for story's sake that it's in your town A hundred brothers taking factories, Warren's law is gutters And now they're handing out free chicken and free peanut butter Free food to the people, how it should be But now let's go a few blocks over to 7-3 Channel 2 says at the mall twelve cops got shot Cause there's eight hundred sisters taking over Eastmont With nines and AK's doing the right think like Spike Lee And now their babies got free Pampers and free Nikes Up at the schoolhouse they said motherfuck a hall pass Until you teach the truth, check it we ain't going to class You're teaching lies, we got wise, now we realize There's no end to this road, you disguised the prize So peep game for real mental penetration Our education's liberation Things ain't gon' never be the same x2 At 6-9 there's a rally and it's swinging Through the crowd with a thousand voices singing Once upon a time in the projects, yo Motherfuckers took over, and now we running the show We don't give a damn about section eight though For what we really need we're gonna have to take mo' The same thing was heard in the A courts In Kendall Village, across the bay in Fillmore And in the hills where all the rich folks live They're in shock we're not failing to vote and build Instead of brothers on stage singing "Do me" A black man has a gauge singing "Do this, see?" All of a sudden everybody is out of jail But it's funny cause no one is out on bail And somebody shoved some police against the wall I guess today they should've worn their clean drawers Cause an ambulance came, that's the reality There's now a new meaning to police brutality All we need is satisfaction We don't want just a fraction And we've come to A conclusion Revolution is the solution Check it Now the uzi's that were once used to kill each other Are now used to serve and protect the brothers And the sisters cause they're packing .45's and nines We're down for revolution not just down for their behinds Cause the word is heard across the bay and in L.A. In New York, NY, Chicago, and Atlanta, G-A We gives a fuck if you've got money and the millions Cause motherfucker we've got posse in the billions So break yourself Bush, it's collection day Break yourself Trump, it's collection day Break yourself DuPont, it's collection day You stole the shit from my great granddaddy anyway The liquor stores around, but they're not selling beer or ale Motherfuckers selling Molotov cocktails To the crew, so light up a brew And this is what is meant by a god damned coup DJ O on the cut y'all Ah yes, K-Mack's on the strings y'all The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: The Coup Album: Kill My Landlord Song: I Know You Typed by: dchakko@netusa1.net [Boots] E, look man look [E-Roc] Yeah wassup man [B] It's that cop man, the one that sent my potna to the hospital Hey pull over, come on [E] Coup let's with this hamhock motherfucker, there we go [B] Hey pig, yeah, remember me?

Seems we need one every time you get a court order Or pull me over in order to check identification I'm in the back of your car with a bruise or laceration You're in the hood and it's one more disaster We know you're here to protect and serve the master Next time you roll through push the gas a little faster I'll turn your blue suit purple, bastard Cause  Chorus x2 I know you motherfucker (Everywhere I turn) I know you motherfucker (Everywhere I turn) I know you motherfucker (Everywhere I turn I'm assuming the position) Verse Two: E-Roc I know you motherfucker, footprints in my door On my back, on my head, through my house and once more You called my mother a hoe, you threw my brother in a headlock You did this to about six thousands on the block Say you try to stop the rock so it makes me perspire Hmm...but you work with a supplier So I inquire what's your role in my elimination? Ain't got a choir so it sure ain't one of salvation But if I sung you a song it'd be of damnation Cause all they do is let me sing in this damn nation Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, how many kids have you killed today? Pig, now I realize our relation Your occupation is to keep me in occupation How many brothers have you left in a cast? How many graves have you made in the past? Useless!

You tell me that a nigger's crazy or lazy Not about the skin so, don't let it faze me Well you amaze me, with that ignorant bizull-shizzit Get a grip on the new fit Cause that's a lame frame of brain for the nineties I know the game so it don't sting, my mind sees So what the fuck you wanna race for the trigger I ain't the one, I ain't the nigga "If I'm a slave, I'm a slave to the rhythm" --> Big Daddy Kane "You know that I ain't the nigga" --> Ice Cube (repeat 4X) (DJ Pam cuts up "Niggers, love everything but themselves" --> Last Poets) [E-Roc] Nigger is a word we use today, you say It don't mean the same if you spell it with an A But that's an argument that makes me itch, I twitch If I took the T out will I still mean bitch? My name is E-Roc, and I ain't the nigger main Save your sellout strut shit for Soul Train Cause I've been known, to knock a motherfucker out Without a doubt, The Coup gives me much clout But there's a factor when I know that my skin is brown And never ever will I put another brother down (gawwwd damn) So I make the mental rule to massacre the word Cause when I hear it, it gets, me straight stirred It's mental trash so I'm pickin up the litter I ain't the one and I ain't, the nigger My people use this word each and every day You see a nigger, slap a nigger, that's what I say "If I'm a slave, I'm a slave to the rhythm" --> Big Daddy Kane "You know that I ain't the nigga" --> Ice Cube (repeat 4X) (DJ Pam cuts up "Niggers, love everything but themselves" --> Last Poets) "Boy I love playing the drums, I can do the grooviest rhythms  I can do rhythms like.." [Boots] My attitude is this (what?) don't call yourself a niggerole (why?) Unless you're just an oakie-doke it'll make you sicker though Cause it's all about a mind-time mind-frame The system is a chess game with, pawns all the same (haa haa) Until we change our mind to ? Identify yourself, it's a part of being concious (yeah) If I call myself a gangster then I'll rob you with a gat (yeah) If I call myself a brother then you know I got your back (yeah) If I call myself oppressed then I'm clear on where I'm at But if I call myself a nigger what the fuck is that? (yeah, you know) Don't be the coolie or the moolie or a boob with the jigger Don't be the one... don't be the nigga "If I'm a slave, I'm a slave to the rhythm" --> Big Daddy Kane "You know that I

Flash *sounds of smoking, coughing, and choking* "Do you know what's green?" *DJ Pam cuts and scratches Cypress Hill "puffin on a blunt"* [Boots] Last night I puffed on my last blunt, damn that was a stupid stunt cause I done said this ten times befo' that when my life has come to a crescendo, I would let that indo go but I'm still kissin it like I'm under the mistletoe So here we go I'm Mork'in with the steady swagger speakin with a stunt, steady stagger preachin with a Southern drawl that sounds like Jimmy Swaggart coughed and played it off Said I know I'm flippin since the last one G my laces are tied so you can't trip with me, I remember 1988 December Someone said, "Puff on this before you go up in her" So I did it and I guess it must have did the trick She enjoyed it so I guess I must have rocked the clit Felt like a man and I loved her with an indo trip Don't know why, cause I couldn't even feel my dick Ego trip lasted and I'm always gettin blasted but it's drastic cause sometimes that shit can help you get your ass kicked Can't buy it with plastic so I'm off to drain the vein for days I get complaints, cause the neighbors say my house stink Call myself a saint, cause I won't touch a bowl of food I gives a fuck, just don't interrupt my Looney Tunes this afternoon cause I can find a job anytime Step off my behind I'm in a Doobie Brothers state of mind Run-D.M.C., AT&T, yo they both Be Illin' I smoked that blunt for last month's three hundred dollar billin And I'm willing to admit that when provoked I smoke to cope but if I didn't take a toke I'd be leadin a street revolt So I make a mental note, and to my frustration I decide I can't do shit about the situation Put the spliff to my lips, flick the Bic and it's on hit Coulda been my last blunt... but I can't quit cause then I have to deal with, some motherfuckin real shit Squeezin me tighter than you gotta squeeze a cow's tit But on the flip tip I know I gotta get a grip even though in high school he used to be hip *coughing* But shit I'm hockin spit like I thought it was worth somethin My throat can't take no more, no future in my frontin But it's rough when you grow up and the tough men roll joints That's why I been on the bench for marijuana to this point But it don't faze me though I take it lacadaisical It takes a while for ways to grow and get out of the old flow But I'm an old bro, I done passed two decades I'm wearin shades so my eyes don't reveal the red haze caused by my yung, cause days like Frankie Beverly Amazin em back it's tried again, no roaches and no safety pins Now I'm pennin rhymes about gettin on the wagon and I get skittish when I think of how the British put the opium in Asia, fat one to that tactic Gankin black folks while they daze ya, if you're gettin perved you're gettin served this economic, like the gin and tonic Brothers get moronic from the chronic bionic, and it's ironic cause we're not gettin fucked up, we're just gettin FUCKED Shit out of luck and we're stuck with our mind in a muck So don't duck the situation cause I used to smoke fat Taylors til I figured out that the ganjah was a jailor Wait a, minute, while I get up in a funky situation The Coup is coming through, and there's no hallucination So what the fuck they say that junk is good for meditation If you smoke a sack, take some Ex-Lax it's mental constipation there's no hesitation when I'm talkin bout political friction Stoppin evictions Government made afflictions and I have an addiction that's a big contradiction so I must confront it Cause ain't no revolution gonna come from a blunt *singers sing "Put the blunt down, oooh-ooh!" 2X* My partner's cousin's uncle got killed by a shooter I'm depressed so there's a rumor Boots is gonna hit the buddah Mary Jane will be alone

Explicit and implicit are the exploits I'm speaking of the society that's living off me No jumps and coast to coasting in a Detroit No I am a factor that they don't need Cause labels are stable in this big world Talking 'bout sex, you're a boy or a girl Talking 'bout a kind you're a jerk or the jerker Talking economics you're the boss or the worker Right about now I'm gonna change the flow Going straight up like my new wave afro I say it and they play it Do you hear me though you're guessing there's a lesson But teach me, I want to know Conjunction junction what's my function? Connected with the genocidal pace of a race reduction Funny there's no money for my people's production The Coup is not through cause we've got some gumption A victim in a system about cold cash If you don't make it then they treat you like trash Dispose of you tonight if not in the morning This is not a prophecy, this is just a warning A clearly cut case co-opted by The Coup An exposé of foul play against me and you Sing it It's funky, it's funky, it's funky, it's a funky situation (x4) Hey hold up we're about to let the DJ scratch here (Well let him scratch then) ... At times I find my mind can think fast Like when a pig has a trigger saying nigger that's your ass Thoughts of a slave master rise from the past The past is the present cause I still feel the lash It's against the law just to be black Cause the war on drugs is just thugs on the attack The C is not the source of course so just get back Why try a lot, I doubt it's just about crack Brothers on the block making bankroll Maybe could the dream be the dream of an overthrow? If so no mo' we'll play the big toe In a shoe that's cramped so break a brother's sole Slip and stuck slowly to the same game Several hundred years we have been in a chain gang Let our shackles only add on to a migraine Old fame, thoughts of pain slowly drive me insane But then I started rapping for The Coup A lot of rappers out there just looking for the pay-off Listen to the message that the Boots brings to you The Coup is just a group to bring order out of chaos People pick problems out and isolate Misguiding many to think it's a mistake Well I'm the Boots and I'm here to set 'em straight My information leads me to think there's foul play A clearly cut case co-opted by The Coup An exposé of foul play against me and you Sing it It's funky, it's funky, it's funky, it's a funky situation (x3) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: The Coup f/ Elements of Change Album: Kill My Landlord Song: Kill My Landlord Typed by: dchakko@netusa1.net (Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?)

Clunked the 40 on the flo' and placed his palm on the dash and wheezed out, "C'mon man, make this motherfucker mash!" Ain't gon' mash too fast, cause my tags ain't right Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Chorus 2X - sung] Oakland do you wanna ride? I can't hear you! Oakland do you wanna ride tonight? [Boots] City lights from far way can makeyou drop yo' jaw Sparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras There's beauty in the cracks of the cement When I was five I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent whatever it was that could break my momma's back Little did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac And matta-fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract And on the track, she went from beautiful to battleaxe And back at home, she would cry into her pillow Vomit in the commode, I was six years old I would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold Never knew how she was sufferin for my food and clothes She asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread I said, "He missin' a arm, and he seem like a pee-pee head" She said, "Don't cuss," and my teeth to go brush And get ready for bed, and the toilet to flush With tears in my momma's eyes, I was her everything Before she went out on the stroll She'd tuck me into bed and sing: 	You're much too beautiful for words {*4X*} I see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies Reminds me of midnight in a dopefiend's eyes And my 9-year-old self as paramedics leave Left to ball my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve To give illustrations that are clear and clean I'll take you two hours back, befo' this scene: Early in the morning when the sun starts to creep When the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep Moms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink Wearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini, and fake mink Even though she served, for fifty dollars-a-pop Hardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped That day the landlady got her rent befo' he got his knot Slammed momma's head against the front bolt lock Then the pump wit one arm done harm Reached back and plowed into her head like a farm Never saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin' Heard the blap blap of tewnty headcrack percussion and body blows, her body froze from bolo's to the spine I was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine She didn't even have the strength to say, "I love you Boo" But I said it to her and she knew that I knew She was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case But I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face Stop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions "S go to Frisco.." (I got very friendly vocal inflections) Mob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Boots] The rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world or that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled My temperatyre gayge read "cold and blistery" Spinnin' wheels made each piece of asphault history This was Jesus debut out the penitentiary Fifteen years, but it seem like a century See, he went in the pen for some other murder drama Twelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp comma You accidentally killed my mom, no playa hation points You know how bitches act, shit exclamation points First it was a set up move, then it was the truth His letters were the only thing I had as a youth But his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit So my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick Cause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus To me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers And I don't think that it's gon' end til we make revolution But who gon' make the shit if we worship prostitution? Ain't no women finna die for the same ol' conclusion Put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em Pulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery Pulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery Jesus said, "Why the hell you pointin' a gat?" So I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat I said, "This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on This is for my mental and my momma that I cried on Microsoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones but since I'm Macintosh, I'ma double click your icons" He struggled for life, then gave up the fight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Boots] And I still remember momma 	You're much too beautiful for words {*4X*} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: The Coup Album: Steal This Album Song: 20,000 Gun Salute Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes} * Beavis and Butthead sample * [Butthead] Whoa!
