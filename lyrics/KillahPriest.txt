Trapped with starvin seeds Fightin for sovereignty Cold nights make the toddler freeze Blood over my wallabies Raining mahogany Here's a dollar for the trees We worship weed like idolatry Silly bitches with conniving thoughts Sticking knives and folks Don't understand what it's like to be a black man in court Niggaz up screamin all night Complaining that their handcuffs are too tight Kicking on the cell till they cut out the lights It's like a curse Walk besides white women they start holding they purse I just ask you for the time bitch What you got anyway? Some of the Indians turf The Beauty that once flowed from the Nile Like the Moses child The hand that writes is a good as the hand that holds the plow [Killah Priest] Some say the spirit of a dead angel lies within me Look in my eyes, they're empty Poverty stricken beaten with the rod ol envy Lurking through the shadows of death Dragging my wings, saw the image of a beast Ram, dragon and queen, heard the bragging of kings Whose laughter was as bitter as a scorpion sting? Forced in the ring with idiots so many cliques Letting out automatic clips A dead lady combing the hair of a bastard bitch I spit graphic shit you ain't hear half of it From my fucked up marriages To dealing with miscarriages From drinking with savages Driving hazardous I'm here today to meet the man from Nazareth Where's the pastor?

And for a grown child, that shit, just wasn't healthy When the bitches hadn't dealt me, never planned to help me But now I'm a man, I understand what's really wealthy It's not about how much tuition

Will I wrestle with this devil whenever I'm sleeping Wake up behind the metal of a federal precinct Or be found in the ghetto taking several of beatings? From policemen, will I die for what I believe in? Will I ride until I'm no longer breathing? I need to know until my soul is leaving through that hole, I see Him Up that road to meet Him and behold His kingdom And I stand before His judgement, my body a ghost I'm seeing dozens of my cousins, distant and close Whether relatives or friends, I remember them both Then I walk, what's that? my end, then a voice had spoke It said.. [Chorus x2: George Clinton] Come with me, I'll take you there Come with me, have no fear [Killah Priest] All I saw was fire and smoke and bodies that roast up Young adults that were under a cloke And took a number of oaths 'til they hung from a rope I said damn, I saw my man pull a gun from his coat Ran up before the preacher popped one in his throat I ain't scared because the chair share hundreds of volts And I know this is not the place that he wanted to go I want to leave because this place here is punishing folks So I fell on both knees, face pouring with sweat When an angel approached me, placed a sword on my neck I cried with every bit of pride all on my breath There I was strapped to a bed having war on my flesh The priest threw holy water on me, called me possessed Doctors held me down but I tore through my vest Psychiatrists came, read the results of my test I threw up over the nurses, left the floor in a mess Come with me! Come with me Chorus x2 [Killah Priest] I dreamed of harm and blood, rusty chainsaws, bodies in tubs That painted walls, saw armys of thugs Saw men made zombies from drugs Enemies from centuries fill my body with slugs There I was in paradise, the marriage of Christ I saw nazarites, all gathered in white Written down in the tablets of life What it means while the church at the Vatican fight? There were flames, I passed through a traveling light, I was changed Became a phantom of the night, the upper plain No longer suffer the same, had enough of the pain Felt a rush in my vein, words stuck in my brain Had nothing to gain, everything to loose Which cliques of the game do I claim to choose?

The game is where I loose my soul How many options did I have before I choose this roll? Let's see, what did spark it? Fuck school and hoes Live in the projects, never rocked the newest clothes It's psychologic, somehow it seems foolish though From my pockets, only love for jewels and dough Catastrophic, the walls came closing in On all sides, the pressure expose the gem A war cry was the breath I was holding in A poor scribe dopest as the golden pen Called wise, blessed among the chosen men The lost tribe, my words were woven in Each line like words I was sewing with I sit divine, my palm hold the globe with a grip Flows I spit, shows I rip, that's showmanship Tell the maid from the robes I fit A blackness covered the moon from a lunar eclipse A passage leads to a tomb beneath the sands of Egypt Candles are lit, and the keys to the pianos are hit There's the phantom, the mummy stands at the cliff Aztec Indians studying my sanscript Puffing peace pipes, Priest gets deep when he writes Bars are mystic, written like Horror-glyphics I made it hard for critics to follow my lyrics Come on!

you see fire when he breathes on the mic The legend has it, his neck and his back is tattered On his arms are scriptures of psalms Just picture a Don with vultures on his shoulder A pearl gun in his holster under the seat One on the chauffer, twisted cobras in front of his ride Gun to his side, blunted eyes Lookin' up at thunderous skys The wonders arrive, statues change position Stone eyes open up, pupils follow me inside This is the time, the twisted mind of Priest White wolves leap out the woods Bite at the hoves of all the horses Return like Christ in the hood And the month now is Black August, c'mon [Chorus: Killah Priest] Pay or deny me, stood right beside me Try to divide me, while all y'all musify me Pay or deny me, stood right beside me Try to divide me, while all y'all musify me [Killah Priest] Picture me on a black cross Black crows near both arms Blood drippin' from both palms And I'm squirmin' cuz the sore of my wounds are burnin' Tossed from the wombs of virgins I seen it all, medical room of surgeons Read it all and the capy version I look down, people spittin' and cursin' Everybody quiet listin' to the sermon Record Exec's dress like Romans Pierce in my side, I'm goin through convulsions Starin' straight to a jet black ocean Three times I heard the rooster crow Cats I used to know denied me but now use my flow Used to feel my taste, my eyes searched the crowd for a familiar face All bein' persecuted for purchasing the music I'm like the works of a Judas Or does it when I hurt my movement While crooked lawyers gamble at the foot of my cross My spirit leaves to the hoods of New York I see streaks of lightning, angels with white wings Above me flapping across the skys They thought I died until one of them heard my cries [Killah Priest] Now I'm back with blood on my hands, blood on my wings Clutchin' two sub-machines, duckin' and screams Two fully loaded magazines with M-16's Clappin' in the crowd, I empty out and reload I squeeze low, with one knee to the flo' I'ma get all you bastards Loadin' up bullets the size of carrots The kind the CIA find on the Arabs When I'm through y'all won't need any caskets I'ma leave y'all for the birds and the maggots Then I'ma strike the matches Burn up ya corpses, it's like I'm possessed by forces Priest the sorceress, then the clouds gather Then the foul scatter, in the air I can taste the warfare Y'all didn't think I'll be back for vengeance Well y'all wrong, nowl suffer the consequences And I came with armed defences Highly trained to break your fences in Chorus [Outro: Killah Priest] Yeah they

Twilight zone [Killah Priest] Stared at me with his cold eyes, who was this old guy? Drug him in the building, as police drive by Took out my four-five, cocked it, put it to his forehead Dugout his pockets, went in his shirt, and took his locket Threw him near the garbage, aimed the gun and shot it Then dodged quick, how that, so fast, felt the wind go past Everything went in a flash, hopped over the trash I ran around the corner, cut up the alley And made to the backdoor in the lobby, then I stopped My eyes was shot, all my stolen goods dropped My body stood still like a rock I saw this kid holdin' a four-five, with the same old guy With the same cold eyes, I looked out the building Saw the same cop car roll by It woke me out the trance when I heard a shot Saw the old man cry, shit drop, by the garbage Kid disappeared somewhere through the project So I chased him, called his name, 'round the corner Up the block, through the alley Though the backdoor into a lobby When I came in, I saw the kid backin' up, with his gat in his clutch And floor full of stuff that he stoled from that man I glanced over the kid's shoulders, I seen the same old man Another young dude with the gun in his hand Pointed at the old man's head, makin' demands I looked out the lobby door, saw the same police man Drove by, it was no surprise, I said shot At the same time I heard a gun pop Looked at the garbage, saw a man lyin' there crotchin' Couldn't believe what I was watchin', I walked near him Should I fear him, I said to myself, it's gettin' weird son I told to old man, stared in his cold eyes At the same time I felt the ghost go by I looked up, saw me, holdin' the four-five I glanced back at him, asked him, what's happenin' What's the meaning? Am I dreaming? He whispered, the locket that you stole from me Open it, there's a picture So I opened the locket on the silver chain Saw a picture of him, and he had the same initials as my name Hope I'm not goin' insane, I can't explain, somethin' is strange I took off the old man's frames, put 'em on my eyes At the same time, the old man died Then I cried, I felt like something inside me died It got weird too, cuz out of nowhere I asked myself, do I fear you? And a beard grew, I felt my face, took out a mirror Looked in it, my hair was silver and in terror My body got cold, I broke the mirror, I felt I was old So I closed the locket, put the chain over my head Hid the picture in my shirt, like a curse I stood up and walked outside Where a kid was waitin' for me, with a loaded four-five I didn't say a word, I just stared in his eyes Said to myself, I know this guy Then he grabbed me by my shirt, then he drug me inside I asked him why, but he didn't reply Fuck it, I might be high He reached in my pocket, he dug in my shirt That's what I thought, damn, my locket Went and pointed the gun and cocked it Then he shot it, no, what's goin' on?... He stared at me with his cold eyes, who was this old guy? Drug him in the building, as police drive by Took out my four-five, cocked it, put it...

Ya'll take and put it in a cage Then take it to the zoo, so ya'll can view all of my rage Toss popcorn at me, No, I'm not happy That's why I'm pacin' back and forth, cause ya'll can read my thoughts Ya'll know when I hunt I leave a corpse My innocence is all that I plead in court I heard you dogg (Chorus) (2x) They said it wasn't extraordinary, it was just a rhyme But I prove the unordinary, stood the test of time, My Flesh, my mind, my spirit arose in the lyrics Was hidden inside of the soul to reveal it Every emotion is an emotion of my pen Words of the gem it shines in the minds of men For those that don't receive light, it blinded them So when they do, push rewind again Over and over till they feel me getting closer Till I'm more than just a picture on a poster Till finally break down on they sofa Then they show love, the room's gettin' colder Then they feel the presence, I give em' the message My words make the hair stand on their arm Embrace my psalms, like a child embrace his moms' So sing along, and feel it forever (Chorus 4x) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Killah Priest Album: Black August: Revisited Song: Greatest Lesson Typed by: ThaMasta@Wu-Lyricz.Com [movie sample] Our reason for fighting is this..

Under your command [Killah Priest *humming the beat during sample*] Priesthood.. I stepped in a church ashamed, naked and hurt Wet from the rain, my face shows pain I'm desperate in search for answers Grabbed the panther that the ushers handed Blood stain shown through my shirt cuz beneath, my arm was bandaged I walked up the aisle but didn't stop 'til I got the altar I was being blocked by the preacher's supporters But he'd seen my torture So-called friends filled me with false love I spoke "Sorry I have nothing to offer but lost hope and an empty soul" See the Devil tempts me like Jobe, everything I had I now owe He took my girl, shook my world, lost my crib It was all his except for my kids That's what I thought 'til I'm at court with my wiz She doubled-crossed me then slid She forced me to live in solitude now the bottle's my food I follow no rules but if the gospel is true Then I'm his apostle like you But he stopped me cold and called me a fool He said I was rude the way I'd intrude Then I tossed him this jewel..

See you have a home and a swimming pool, the big backyard (yeah?) Large living room, fed with a silver spoon You probably sinning too but don't know Pardon me if I'm offending you but I won't go I question my faith, been in a depressional state (yeah man) Self-hate, one day blessings will wait Stared death in his fate, planning my 'scape I've seen D's stretching out tape I've 'visioned prison dates, injected with the venom of snakes Women with grapes, slept with in rooms pyramid-shaped Walls covered with hieroglyphics, I'm far from religious It was said in my first introduction which was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth For me it went deeper than just reading a verse Seeing it first, I needed work [Outro: Killah Priest] {*humming to the beat and whistling*} You know it's real, K.P The picking cot had been lockened Daily..

[Killah Priest] The last supper, Christ around the master brothers Same story but this time they have color Stars and moon hover, everybody wrapped in covers In the upper, the lamb's tell him what he has to suffer Last cup of wine poured, a knock at the door Simon Peter had his hand locked on the sword Every eye watched the Lord to see what he do But he was peaceful, before he knew The time was at hand, they should kill the Son of Man So the man sat down, all the disciples around him Him and his center, then entered the twelth member And Christ reached down, took a loaf of bread Divided it amongst twelve heads Then he spoke and this is what he said "This is my body for rememberance, I'm dead Likewise, after we sup', in this cup is my blood Which shall be shed for you for the love" He said his grace then "Let's grub" Everyone dug in their plate by Christ's face didn't budge I guess he was searching who the snake was Then he said "Also one of you shall betray me" Take Matthew, looked at him like he was crazy He felt scared then they all worried Asked him, "Who could it be?" Then he said, "The one who dipped his hand in the dish with me At the same time I do mine that shall be the sign" His head in a forward direction, he reached down Across the table, Judas reaches like his own shadow reflection I guess every could stop guessing So Judas looked around the table like "What the fuck?" He got up and walked out Everyone shocked, covered their mouth (Oh shit that's Judas son? I can't believe it!) [Chorus: Killah Priest] In the day that we live We live, never consider those that were here before us Did the same deeds so they wrote to warn us Though as it was written, let it be told Check for the clues as the story unfolds [Killah Priest] So the Messiah chased him to Mount Olive Told every man to stay awake, at least to daybreak Beware of traitors and snakes, keep the faith Describe your falecies after me, then the chapter reads. Upon the hill where he kept it real, he knealed Told the Lord, if it's his will, let it done The death of his son, will have his reward when the ressurection comes Then he rode from his prayer, glored of his hair, walked down from the lair Saw his disciples lying there, screamed on them With that he walked back to his PJ's Then he begins to talk about how he's betrayed Die and rise in three days and Peter so afraid That he spoke out in rage, stop the land from speaking He said, "Whoever put his hand on my Lord, we'll kill 'em all This is the acts of a real Christian", but Christ just listened Leaned back recalled a vision, told him coldly "In the final hour, before the rooster crows three times You will deny that you every known me" At the same time Judas comes back with a money sack attached to his jock strap, gave him a kiss on the jaw Christ asked, "What was that for?" Soldiers kicked in the back door Like cops, Peter whipped out the ox [Interlude: Killah Priest] Damn.. to be continued Then.. a View From Masada You'll know the stories unfold every time [Killah Priest] Shots were fired, screeching tires, cars peal off Screaming kid knealing by the sidewalk Cops swarming at night dressed like cyborgs Villains escaped from a time off In 2000, crime in New York.

there's a balcony, that's where I would be I look again, now there's crowded seats And an audience surrounding me, the lights go low And out of nowhere, my notepad glows Then a motion screen show, my

admission, all you gotta do is pay attention My ushers guide you, to where I'll be sitting It's the intermission, all you gotta do is listen To get a clear vision, the way I be spitting The story changes with the rhythms It comes at you in 3D, it's not just a CD It's more like DVD (to tape it), I turn radios to TV's My pen: the projector, and I'm the director Each line guides my recta, I turn looseleafs to whole movies Color show is Rudy, a film written by him, rated KP Bring your lady or your babies, sit through the album Turn up the volume, stare at the speakers Til suddenly your in the bleachers Lookin' at the main features, viewing the coming attractions Guns blastin', tons of action [Killah Priest] I got love stories that turn gory From Mafia hits, to politics, follow my lips Acknowledge my flicks, once I stopped writing, the room brightens I pick up my pen, then the movie ends I stop the flow, then the curtains close The audience stands and leaves the rows At the same time, another group comes to see the show I put down my pen, then the movie plays again It's the vision, what I'm sayin', rewind the time in your mind Yo, sit back, the seat reclines, you read the credits A barrage of letters, the ink comes up in cartoons I'm in a dark room, the words become characters Actors, with leading roles I talk from the bullhorn, which is the pen I hold Capital letters become buildings filled with children Or merry-go-rounds, lights, cameras, action, the stereo sound My pen's a wooden puppet, and I'm the ventriliquist I turn listeners to the vision-ists My hands

An old man told me once, sitting on a chair rolling a blunt "I had a son your age, that ended up on front page From the impact of a 12 Gauge, his assassination Drove me in a world of hatred, today it's hard to face it" He showed me old flicks, he was up for a scholarship But it ended by a hollow tip Damn I never thought life could be so short I still see him on the basketball court Fought in my life, I shedded great tears Tryin' to escape here, but for me it might take years Walk towards these fears and I'm still here. He rolled back in his wheelchair and said, "The streets is vicious and all the witches play you for your riches They blow you kisses and show you stitches" So then he pulled back his pictures [Chorus - replace "beware of your Deathwish" with "expect the unexpected"] [Chorus 2X] [Outro: Hell Razah] The final saga of the street operas, of the street operas The final saga of the street operas Bible shit..

May it fly high start soaring pass the corpse of kings Beyond the cloud scraping mountains Travel the way of the falcon To a tucked away enchanted Island You land see the ruins of his old palace The wide stone steps that leads to his throne You see his face made of hard stone He just sit there and zone My eyes are open but they're empty as the painted eyes on a doll Walk inside the fog sit beside my catalog See his face?

No hazard lights on, never stopping for gas Never to think what we did wrong Those freeway signs say we passed, says: "Slow Down" But you on the road now You see the accident; you figured you'll go around So without your signal lights on you switch lanes Into the other dude's path in the past we had big names Radio on the forecast said there's black clouds and thick rain Somehow you think of the cat you blasted in the past "Thick Cash" was his nickname; we all brought up in hard luck Elevators with beer bottle and piss stains Or was it the ice in the mixture of the liquor That made you sleep with your wife's sister Or was it the ambulance lights that made you see the bright picture You wake up; the horn's blowing, the engine running The next sign up the road reads: "The End is Coming" (Hook) Priest "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" [Killah Priest] So you put your hand back on the key, you turn the ignition Taking off at full speed, a rider's ambition Caught an empty bottle Tequila in the passenger seat Glance up in the rear view mirror start patting your cheeks Gotta stay awake, all the alcohol got you falling asleep All the poisonous toxins your body absorbed in a week Look in the same mirror again See all your so called friends sitting behind you And that remind you Of all your mother's words that you was blind to You lose control over your wheel You begin to swerve beyond the lines and almost blew Your tires, bad news for the driver Your heart's racing fast, there's no off ramp for you to get gas Just a dark crooked path, you pray patrol lights flash But when you look through the glass your whole life pass You see a sign up ahead, it's the toll On the other side is the crossroad The croak lady smiles, mother something She said up ahead the accident one miles says: "The End is Coming" (Hook) Priest "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" "The End is Coming" [Killah Priest] The forming nature of man was designed as God planned Till it was destroyed from the fruit from one hand Then we built a fruit stand A life reduction, reluctant to get sucked in Our luck ends in the cuffs to the pens Then there's a prayer discussions Angels or devils, tough decision When an narcotic is doing most of the discussion with us Thank goodness we came to the status of a relic Affectionately regarded, it's true But it's irrelevant to our times Devilishment fill our minds And not to glorify it, 'cause I side with the righteous It brings out life best in abundance Dice bets up in the hundreds Gamble with death, the price is set for us to be hunted But what did the streets do for us?

He laughs on the outside but his mind is serious I can tell he knows more then he shows Street clothes, but his brain is a UFO Have you eva had a conversation wit 'em?
