"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer" How will the family explain it? "My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!" He ain't around to see her walk Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up when his girl has to raise a BASTARD child It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard A big time dope dealer's all she wanted who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it The situation's got me guessin.. but the answer remains to be a question He lived his life in a lie I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die .. [Scarface] It was crazy how it happened Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds and the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground A woman yelled - get an ambulance But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance You shoulda seen him, he was scared A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head He just laid there in silence.. and all I heard was the sirens Paramedics pulled up.. followed by a law man and then came a firetruck Put his ass on the stretcher.. but if he survives, I'm willin to betcha he'll be out for revenge They patched him up within a week he was back at it again Went to his brother on the Northside Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride Packed it up in the trunk AK-47, M-11 and a pump Rolled by ?? on Scott Street School was lettin out, "Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?" "WATCH ME!" Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun.. .. he shot him Put his tooly on the front seat Continued his mission, as he headed down the street The kids was just starin at each other J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch On his way down Cullard His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?" "Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit" "Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch" Went to the store to use the payphone Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. homey" Hung it up and rolled down Dagger Headin for the nigga he was after By the time he arrived at the scene Malcolm was ready for anything He tried to sneak around the back way Never thought of bein taken out on that day Black boy, black coat Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat He didn't fall so he fired One to the middle of his skull, he's expired A whole army came out Twenty-seven niggaz all strapped out of one house That how it happens in the acre One nigga died in the park in the paper Shit gets deeper but why?

He ran by a friend of mine, it bugged him His eyes showed fear, that's the reason why he stuck him Anyway, that's how I seen it You rarely see a nigga kill another nigga, and he doesn't mean it So that's the way I took it Anyway the boy is dead, no matter how you look at it And life goes on.. I was feelin kinda funny - aiyyo something's wrong I went to take a shower Duke Bumped into the wall and I smooth went through Now I'm thinkin I'm in trouble I reached to touch my face, but I couldn't feel my beard stubble I screamed, "Oh Lord help!" Looked into the mirror and I couldn't see myself I called up my mom's house and realized somethin was wrong, no doubt She picked up, said "Hello" in a low tone I said, "Hey ma!" and she hung up the telephone Sick and lookin weary My cousin walks in, I said, "What's up?" but he didn't hear me Started packin up my shit G Looked at a picture of me, put it down and said, "Rest in peace" Realizin what he said man I can't talk, I don't exist, I'm a dead man Yeah I guess I'm dead right?

(verse 2) Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house Scope a 40 bag and we hit the spot Put my shit in park and got up under the tree Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3 Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke A nigga chillin' cause it's all good And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood But other niggas don't wanna see it that way But all I got to say is: you don't wanna see that S.A. Because we're all upon a mission Killin don't make us no different And dyin don't make it no different Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year Than the muthafuckin Bingos lost last year So ain't no muthafuckin' thang for me To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me Chorus... (verse 3) Formaldehyde smokin, niggas gettin' loc'ed and Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit (It ain't no muthafuckin' peace when they see me) Cause we never had a muthafuckin' peace treaty So I know I got to get em with game And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that I never give a second chance to pull the first gun Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one And that's the one that can close the shop So you gotta stand and hold the glock Cause in my muthafuckin' hood, that's how it be But when you're rollin' through your muthafucking hood, what do YOU see?

Total darkness and ease be at all one I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate You took his life, but his memory you'll never take You'll be headed to another place And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face [Verse 3: Scarface] I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong But you kinda scared to die and so you hold on And you keep on blacking out cause and your pulse is low Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears The rigormortis starts to set, now you outta here You start your journey into outer space You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light And you see the ones you never learn to love in life Make the choice let it go but you can back it up If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Scarface Album: The Diary Song: One Typed by: hhirjee at hotmail [Verse 1] Sittin' at the stop light lookin at hoes Peeping out this bitch in her black Girsauds Windows rolled up tight, top was closed Blowin swisher sweet smoke out my nose Open up the door and asked the bitch what's up Lookin' at me crazy, I'm like bitch what's up She asked about my woman, I said my woman at home I asked about her nigga, she said her nigga was gone I got my pencil and got her digits and things And after three or four days I gave that bitch a ring We started talkin and I dropped some shit Gave her some game and now I got that bitch Now she wants to give your homie some ass But there's just one question I got to ask [Verse 2] I called my homie, told my homie it's on Gotta few hoes that wanna moan and groan They on they way I just hung up the phone And we gone be like Marvin Gaye, nigga, gettin' it on But you gots to keep your head right And make these bitches feel at home Cause these Bitches got they head tight And furthermore, they bringin' weed Just kick back nigga follow my lead [Verse 3] Hung up the horn and the hoes arrived Three tight young tenders, them hoes was live Rolled herself a wooler, told her fade me true Cock bustin at the seams of her Daisy Dukes Ass fatter than a motherfuckin quota hoe Ready to take one of these bitches to the slaughterhouse Got my shirt over my dick cuz it's hardened to fuck Cuz I get real daddy wantin to fuck It's about time to put the game in attack Tapped and told her what's her name in the back Got em in my room about to hop in the tub My homie walked in, "shit, brad, what's up?"

Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin the pain Turnin circles in my ninth grade, dealin cocaine Too many hassles in my local life, survivin the strain And a man without a focus, life can drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin it change But when I focus on reality, we broke and enchained Had a dream of livin wealthy and makin it big Over football chose to cook raw, would take it and dig And after all my momma's thankin God for blessin her child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile Smile [ Johnny P ] Smile for me Would you smile Would you just smile for me [ Verse 3: 2Pac ] Fuck the world, as we are loc'in witness furious speeds Unanswered questions keep us all stressin, curious G's Backstabbed and bleedin, crooked thoughts laced with weed Learnin, duckin stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin Inhalin sherm smoke, visualize the flames Will I be smothered by my own pain? Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us Takin pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they get us Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins Since I entered many penitentaries the best revenge Is fuck friends, we military minded soldiers Bustin shots blindly tryin to find Jehovah  To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy Scared to drop a seed hopin I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words, make the world change And still I smile, nigga [ Scarface ]  And now a moment of silence Let us pray And as you journey into outer space May the angels help to lead the way May the prayers that our families made Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that have passed away Be there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you head to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayer for the homie 'Pac [ Johnny P ] Smile Would you just smile for me (Smile) Smile for me Would you just smile for me Smile for me All you need to do is smile for me Woooo-oh smile for me Come on Smile for me The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Scarface Album: The Untouchable Song: Smartz Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch [ VERSE 1: Scarface ] It's been a long time comin But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit I keep the strong rhymes runnin My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit It's all about the real, nigga I keeps it real, nigga And won't sell out for Girbaud or Tommy Hilfiger Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see The side of society they don't see on TV So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook' Now look, we're livin under laws that they set Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit And slowly but surely the shit changed From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided And blacks, we get lost in the sauce because we unguided These muthafuckas had a plan from the start Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart They smart [ CHORUS: Devin / (Tony 'Scarface' Montana) 2X ] They smart, man (Those guys...)

lilredfreak@yahoo.com {Scarface} Man I met this chick so fine So bad She made me sick some time I just had to fuck this bitch one time I met her in the galleria shopping, buying  Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that But man she had an ass so fat You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants Walked behind her whispering love songs She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit And told her try it Replied, while with these light brown eyes I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size She put it on so I paid for  Then I told her she could keep it And then I walked out the store, it's our secret But peep it Made it down the hall, she came running Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning  I don it Made a mack move and girl chased me And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces It's tasteless But honey must of missed being treated Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating Her ass behind the silly shit And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this Let's see the sights, its me tonight Let's leave him stuck home pacing Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces Chorus: You must be used to all the finer thangs Infatuated by what money brangs It seems to me you hoes will never change So all that's left is for us to exchange {Too $hort} I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it They make a nigga feel like he doing something The pussy so good have you through with money But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch Quite a few niggas got the pussy But everytime I see her got to stop and look Cause she so damn fine bitch I want to make you mine bitch I want to fuck one time bitch Short Dogg's on your mind bitch I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick It make me bust this It's hard to hold back when it's this good  You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch Repeat Chorus: {Devin} Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my piss I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it  I bust 4, 5, 6 nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house I know thats my bitch And she don't tell nobody shit She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop The nut skeeted out like thick white snot She saw it was still hard and said look what I got Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces Repeat Chorus: {Tela} I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices Saying its about six or seven dime pieces We can hook up with no chains and no leashes Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin for three Nights Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized Thinking to myself at this time and realized She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my suprise Enter the room with the cat ass eyes Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit Girl stop licking right there you killing me Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me So I dips into the world of

lean and blowed everyday I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive All my life this drive I tried I seen a lot of good niggas die Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched Or somebody's a bitch I wish I could change the past But I gots to live in the present and pray that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself I found out she had to told me Just to show me just how good I had it  I guess I couldn't see it Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it  But that was just the way we used to G it One of the wrongest niggas I see Or one of the strongest niggas I know Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know So I put weed in the bong and I

prayers to a man I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun I guess that's true for some But them hoes will never win Out here just hustlin and grindin  Tryin to change from niggas to men Chorus (3-2) My

Typed by:nelly_ei@hotmail.com * * send corrections to the typist (Kelly Price) What can I do? What can I do, to make it better? Yeah, yeah (Scarface) I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain Down the park, I hear the sirens, just screamin' away And then the unevitable happens, the end of them days As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away) I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn Down to the ash, it remindes me of the now and the passed I say a little prayer, 'cause eventually I'll stand in the path Of the souls and dark rows that lead to rest (Chorus) Do you hear them, crying? Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me) Take away their fears And then a child is born Bloody legged, clingin' to life Unaware of his surroundin's or breathin' is right In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive) At the same time, another mother, murders her kids And the unbarable thought of this hear, just' brings me to tears It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I can't help All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact That if I heard one of my seeds is dealin' with that That'd be the hardest thing, I'd ever have to do in my time I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't glide Instead what he'd, what you hear me singin' bout it in my ride And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go (Chorus) Do you hear them, crying? Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better) Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through) What can I do? What can I do? I say "goodbye" to your cruel world I see peace to the red sky I see these are where the dead die, leavin' my head high And if the streets up ahead crowd with the heat from the lead fly But the grief when I said "Bye," pull the sheets on my bed dry We're turnin' the table, we tellin' a tale That the destruction of human flesh, and it not so great Long list of the John Doe's, and Kauntly the spirit With them jails of souls lost, we hope that God hears it Resurection very harsh, crowdin' in the room Muffle sounds on the outside, echo the tomb But I'm cold (Kelly Price) Do you hear me? I'm cryin' (Chorus) Do you hear them, crying? (x2 to fade) Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears (take away their fears) Can I make it, better?

Someday, someday, someday... Someday, someday, someday He'll come to get me I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps Talk with you to find out where my good's kept I been gone away from home for so long Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree Ain't afraid to admit it, scause I seen niggas worse than me Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself In the dark, trying to get me some help I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn Doing my best to try to ease out the storm I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light And I prepared a new beginning in Christ My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine **Chorus [Faith Evans]** I know god is watching from above Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love And although life is full of adversities I know he's with me, he's with me I know someday, someday, someday...

It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it **Chorus [Faith Evans]** I know god is watching from above Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love And although life is full of adversities I know he's with me, he's with me I know someday, someday, someday... Someday, someday, someday... Someday, someday, someday He'll come to get me Lord I know that I've been wrong They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song So I'm singing on my knees cause I believe you'll keep me strong Until it's time for me to bring it home But until it's time for me to bring it home I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power And given all his glory to god cause god towers Over all, and in that I save this prayer For all my homies that's been trapped out there That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out Then you'll understand what I'm talking about **Chorus [Faith Evans]** I know god is watching from above Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love And although life is full of adversities I know he's with me, he's with me I know someday, someday, someday... Someday, someday, someday... Someday, someday, someday He'll come to get me I know someday, someday, someday... Someday, someday, someday...

Let me know Do the saved souls travel the road of the souls lost? How come the dead can't talk? Through horrified eyes I can picture the other side And though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry Watched my homeboy die, day by day body tired Remember, I finally accounted before he expired They tell me there's a peaceful place, I wanna see it They say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it And though I appreciate bein alive Sometimes I wanna see how it feels to just die Come back and tell my story to the ones who really know me Converse with the angels and elders that went before me And satisfy the hunger for those who wanna know If there's life after death, and if so, where we go I often find myself involved in deep thought I wanna see is heavens a place like we thought And Christian science seems to think it's just a mindstate But before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait Or better yet, I take the journey for myself Put a bullet in my own head, it's my death So when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9 ( *gunshot* ) suicide Just as I thought, a bright light Greeted by friends and family, so life-like Black and in between screams and then peace Lookin in the eyes of the grieved and deceased Father pleace, send me back, I don't wanna die I'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie And during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm And I woke up singing this song [ CHORUS ] I been a pawn and I been a king And I been down since the beckoning I try to look beyond the sight of sound And the lights come from the underground Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound And through my quest for the answers, know what I found? I found that regardless to what people say The shooters gotta do it day for day So make your peace [ VERSE 2: Scarface ] Open your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight And link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate And enter the minds of the ones who are blind And shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme I preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet Cause everyday it's niggas lyin dead in the street We stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days Fuck what they say, cause ain't no comin back from the grave So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out Then you'll understand what I'm talkin about I had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the makin The ruler of this new world was Satan The sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playin Then I woke up, my imagination Runnin wild but then again the coming of Christ Could be the moment of any minute, now or tonight So make your peace, cause 666 is the mark of the beast It's dark in these streets And some might see it hard to believe but God is in me And yea, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness I know I'm protected cause I'm convicted Anybody believin in the Big Bang Theory And thinkin that thyself is the God, you need to hear me How do you explain The skies, the moon, the stars and the rain The sun and the sea The Earth without form facing the deep Darkness and challengin the powers that be It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds Didn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth? This heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth I'm tellin what few tongues of the evil will despise My intention's to revitalize, still I revive And I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons And I'm on my knees steady stressin You make your peace [ CHORUS ] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Scarface f/ Tanya Herron Album: Balls and My Word Song: Spend the Night Typed by: Thugni99a13728@yahoo.com This a wake up [ VERSE 1: Scarface ] Ain't nothing like the Sunnyside sunshine (sunshine) Hitting corners ducking one-time In my platinum color four dog Tinted out roll rolls (yea I roll, roll) I hit the beach and I say tops down Girls with they tops down (whistle) They got bikinis and they thongs on Dancing to the thong song (thong song) [ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ] You been to blocks and drinking brews You been hanging out with your crew But I'm rolling the spotty for you Can I spend the night with you You been to blocks and drinking brews You been hanging out with your crew But I'm rolling the spotty for you Can I spend the night with you [ VERSE 2: Scarface ] I see that lately that my loves on Stop at Papa Joes and get my grub on I ran into my old fling Tasha Still looking cute but she was knocked up (knocked up) I'm like ay how you been girl I see you finna have a kid girl The funny thing about Tasha (what's that) Is that she was destined to be knocked up (knocked up) She twenty-nine and still a cold freak But she got a baby in the car seat She wanted to be seen in all the funk spots Still getting crunk staying drunk huh (drunk huh) The Friday nights are still the same things Looking for diamonds and the chrome things (bling, bling) I'm sitting in my Benz in a nice spot I bet you want to be my wife huh [ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ] You been to blocks and drinking brews You been hanging out with your crew But I'm rolling the spotty for you Can I spend the night with you You been to blocks and drinking brews You been hanging out with your crew But I'm rolling the spotty for you Can I spend the night with you [ VERSE 3: Scarface ] And I been lonely for a long time That's why I'm glad the baby ain't mine Ran up to the door but left my car keys I went back in the store and I saw Daffany Lookin like she did back in eighth grade (eighth grade) Just like she did back in eighth grade We used to skip school and do the wild thang And I'm like daffany was up man I just got out law school She said attorney for the criminals I'm making six figures every six months She said she had everything a bitch want And been lookin for a nigga for her whole life (whole life) Don't you want to make me your wife?

Waking up in the morning and laying down the night with the same face looking at you all the time Realizing now that happiness was hard to find You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great And she don't suck dick like she used to do Force a nigga into trying to find him something new And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this But girl there's one thing happening that you can't forget [Scarface] But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you Because you got more miles than a F-350 You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles Pussy got a snap like a turtle And you can catch a nigga on the late night Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite And make a man out of him quick cause of how you handle the dick It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover make me look fucked up, because unlike those others I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan So you can't get mad because I am not your man Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan for you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that [Scarface] For me to say that, "I do," would be a lie because I don't believe no woman is right for me so I won't Try to talk myself into thinking she is And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man But for every one woman, there's a man, home man Saying, "Damn, I done spent six years in this shit the first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped" And then that's it, had to make some new plans 'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man Now you're hurt all alone, steady hitting her phone But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone And if I ever say, "Maybe," and you thought that I might You consider, just imagine what my wife was like And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist:	Scarface Album:	Made Song:	Dollar Typed by: sheeshumunga@hotmail.com Dollar...

Ben-Ari f/ Anthony Hamilton, Scarface Album: The Hip-Hop Violinist Song: Sunshine to the Rain Typed by: gcampoamor_glez@hotmail.com * * send corrections to the typist I spent my years isolated Couldn't live with myself I was trouble as a young kid My tears didn't help Very depressing and it was evident I'd fade to the deep All alone like these four walls came at me Barracaded cause my mind state I just wanted to die Never happiness Just sad time living a lie Rater leave me I was suicidal Slittin' my wrist Mamma thinking I was crazy Like use some sense And on them days I was feeling I was paining inside It wasn't me It was my inner feeling coming alive I remember waking up like I was going to school Left me standing in the hospital Locked in this room Put away I was a troubled kid losing my mind Fallin' short Of what they expected from me everytime So don't fault me if you meet me And I look to be strange I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain Sunshine to the rain When it comes it goes again Even when the story ends Just turn the page and begin again Sunshine on cloudy days Don't hate me I'll never change Thankful I was made this way Your sunshine for cloudy days Now I was raised in a neighborhood With half of a dime If you was real it was understood It showed in your eyes Every corner had a different hustle Sprawled on your face Drug wars Growin' up raw cause violence the case .... had to move along Quiet it's kept Spoken words got you dealt with So ride with yourself I'm a juvenile They telling me get down for they wealth No getting high Cause when you gettin' high You needing some help As far as help Mine was middle though You know how that go Psychologically I deal with demons talkin' in codes Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus Somewhere on this road Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying no Better of if I was dead Cause they killing me slow All in all it's just a part of my life Watching the show Ain't nothing never came to niggaz sleep Except for a dream It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the screen I prayed my last days of sunshine Just die in the rain Kinda selfish But I know that dying Eases the pain Heartfelt words Spoken hurt Provided the frame For the picture I done painted for the master to explain So I leave behind my testimony Witness to give Far from holy But this matrimony provided the script To live on And live by Grow up and grow on Get on and get by So forth and so on And this here's the last days I can hear the horns singin' I can see the red sky I can hear the drum beating I seen the dead die How long will they mourn Jesus At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings And while leaving you here Believe what you believe in But you don't want to not believe Believe in seeing Don't take this here too personal Cause I'm just speaking This is my family on my mind The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Benzino f/ Scarface, Snoop

Here it comes...   It's - it's a girl {Big Mike:} 1971 a young girl gave birth Only a child, bringin another child on this earth Only 15 years of age But comin from the ghetto, it won't make the front page See, that's the way shit go And to the government she ain't nothin but another hoe Thinkin all she want is food stamps Give her a check and let her hang with the school tramps And mama's gettin mad Cause now she gotta watch her little girl grow up fast Straight ghetto life, straight ghetto drama Wanted a baby doll, now she's somebody's mama And life is so confusin to her Askin herself why is this happenin to her So now she gotta choose Between a box of Pampers and a pair of new tennis shoes Never had to make that choice before Never heard a baby's voice before And the daddy ain't nowhere to be found Too busy bein a hoe around town He just fall into another statistic Claimin black men don't do shit But that's the way it is And little do they know daddy also sheds tears Cause he don't know what to do Be a father to his child, or run with a crew You might say: easy choice, be a father But why should he do it when his father didn't bother? Just another sample, I guess Of black men settin bad examples Thinkin deep about the whole thing Takes his last bit of money and goes to buy a gold ring And askes her to marry her Promise to get a job, so he can carry her Thinkin that's the way to do it But little do they know that there's much more to it Cos marriage is demandin It takes lots of patience and understandin But they go and tie the knot anyway And they'll be gettin their own crib anyday The first couple of months were alright A new crib, adaptin to a new life But then came the arguments And the constant fightin got em thrown out their appartment So now they gotta move in with her moms And that just adds to the muthafuckin problems Cause now he's feelin like he failed And while they asleep he grabs his shit and bails Smooth out the do', black And never takes another look back Now grandma's house is an unhappy home Now that daddy's gone {Scarface:} Daddy broke before I stepped in this muthafucka And left the job to be done by my mother's mother Raised up by grandmother ??? Cause my mark-ass daddy never came around for guidance So now I'm forced to stand up on my own two Cause mommy dear had to work three jobs, duke He didn't even want my friendship I guess the mark-ass nigga wasn't down to begin with Too lit to come around with his drunk ass And beatin up my mom with his punk ass And shit got dread I guess I shouldn't talk so bad about my dad So here it is, brothers If you gon' have babies, you need to father them muthafuckas Cause if you don't in due time Your kids'll speak about daddy exactly like I do mine So do yourself a favor Take your kids to the park, buy em shit, and they'll pay you later But payin's not the issue If you'd die right now your little kids wouldn't even miss you So put away your caddy Call your bitch up and tell her to make room for daddy Cause if you don't you'll be alone And the only thing they'll say about daddy, is daddy is gone Artist: BK-One f/ Brother Ali, Scarface Album: Radio Do Canibal Song: American Nightmare Typed by: Timm2014@hotmail.com It's an American Nightmare We don't fight fair We take lives here Done gone [Verse One: Brother Ali] Untouchable Rain, sun or cool Breeze, ease, the pain crack another brew Ghetto public school, leak rain from the roof Troubled youth, was your name?

slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet And my pop, was a rolling stone 15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone A long way from home, on this road I roam Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man [Hook - 2x] [Lil Ron] Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted That's tragic, happened right on my block I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone But hold on, trash talking ain't my game Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range Peep this it ain't a secret, them
