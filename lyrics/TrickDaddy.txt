to get just for bout anything Pure survival, I want to talk with him He said he was too busy for that but I was more than willing the walk with him So as we walked, he talked and I just listened He said theres a big difference between crackers and niggaz And he said white folks look out for the white folks But uhh...black folks blame other black folks when there ain't enough black folks But yo...to make a long story short We need to pay more attention and do things thats way more convincing He told me you know, I wouldn't say something that wasn't worth it And I damn sure wouldn't waste my time tellin you something that'll hurt you Its your fault for anything if you done stand for something thats for certain But niggaz don't be listenin and that shit be hurtin Not all of us but some of us And if we don't hurry up, they gon bury each and every life of us [Ludacris] Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues just being sober Lifes a bitch and I can't control her I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder The government stand us up to run us over And in the hood, they don't seem to understand, god damn What's really got me wondering if this part of the bigger plan?
