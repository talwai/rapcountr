Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggaz through hell Hell's fire, I never lie, you'll never grind I know the priors they runnin by us when we do crime I know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life When the day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write down your fate you record it that night, a reporter replied The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind No one fake, I'm a realest in strive, of a bilion in five Well a billion cause the limit is the sky, and I live on cloud nine And I recognize my nemesis gon' try but I'm finishin my shine But pussy where it hurt you, life in the Power Circle [Outro: Rick Ross] Regardless of how it goes down {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} Life goes on, am I right?
