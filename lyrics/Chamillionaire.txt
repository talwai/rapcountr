Screw must've been the truth, I never heard nobody slander Screw Not the music but the man, how respected of a man are you? Every time they speak about Screw they always will mention love I'm not gon' lie, my side of town ain't seen nothing like that cuz And niggas that I remember are gone and the reason might be because Well, I could sit here and point fingers but who the hell am I to judge?

Thang sour, when every kiss use to seem like the first kiss Now do I desert this partnership, or just work this out When I know damn well, the problems gonna resurface Forget the less cause first it's money, cause money turned this Into real estate purchases, and Gucci purses I ain't no expert kid, but I'll tell ya I learned this Entertainment game can, come with permanent curses Either she telling you, you the father of her kids Or slamming the do' in your face, like it's none of your biz' Living this earth is, harder than red dirt is Plus society gon judge you, on what you worth is I'm trying

no sis I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds At 17, best believe they're a beautiful breeze Of fresh air when there's nothing else, I usually need Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her The groupies get at your boy, but you're my Cinderella Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse While you healing a nigga feelings, your's are usually hurt It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work And you put in overtime, because you notice I'm in more danger than I've been in lately, rap is mo' than rhymes But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right And that's speaken like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping That comfortabally ain't enough for me, anything that you needing I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks Ain't nothing gon interrupt, you'll sink deep into them sheets and peep [Hook] [Chamillionaire] How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell Hard to live with the thought of this, ring that you use to wear As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail Argument after argument, drama wasn't hidden well Talkin it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off in the trails Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking The cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching Yeah they gon have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust Standing up cuz I had enough, for my blessings not adding up Take too many things for granted, right after that metal gat'll bust Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us [Hook] [Chamillionaire] A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish safe guard your woman and your family, even your own life for granted Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my culture divided So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right 'fore they bury me Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me Into pieces like death was dealt, was not even fair to me To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy Staying humble's the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me I live life so successfully, and

I know a lot of people talk Like they don't write down their lyrics and they do it all in their head But me, hey I take pride in writing down lyrics man I used to scratch out everything on the paper And change the whole rap, up until I felt it was perfect I used to perfect my craft so much and just make each rap Be the best one that I could possibly make it And I try so hard to, you know To get back to that feeling I used to have, but I just can't you know I look at a piece of paper now and it just doesn't give me that same feeling it used to No matter how hard I try, people say that the industry will burn you like that And they say it's mainly because of the pressures in the record industry but I don't know man, I don't know what it is but I just know The same feeling I used to get from music, I just don't get anymore like I remember the feeling I used to get when I heard them live instruments on Snoop Dogg's Gin & Juice Or you know when 'Pac was going off on everyone in the industry or Or when Scarface and 2Pac did a song for the first time Or the first time I heard UGK's One Day I was like "Maaaan", them boys real Or even when I was bumping that east coast music And I heard Canibus say a verse on The Firm album, he was like "At a thousand degrees Celsius I make y'all iggans melt, F' my record label, I appear courtesy of myself!" I was like "Maaaaaaaan" hahaha, man that boy killed dat And I even used to be bumping Wu-Tang Clan I remember Method Man was like, you know it um "I came to bring the pain, hard core from the brain" I was like "Man them boy's throwed" And I can't put the blame on nobody You know I can't just say I don't like music all music There's a lot of music I like, but I just don't like it the way I used to And that goes for all of it, including me Even when I'm in the studio, and I'm behind the mic It just ain't the same man, you know I like to talk man, that's the realest part of everything to me But I don't get to speak what's on my mind like I am now Like I do at the awards, you know?

Guess I was blessed with my wish Don't tell me that you feel my pain that I seen, it's best that we switch You take the fortune and fame and see if it's what you expected Take the money and change and be careful where you invest it Just take the test and don't stress it, you get stopped by a detective Tryin to get in your personal life, gotta do your best to protect it The answer rests in the message, when I go I go in a blaze But it won't be no Captain Save 'Em cause where I'm goin you saved Tryin to rain down on my parade 'til that umbrella get raised They thinkin that they can read me when they ain't nowhere my page Tryin to keep a smile on my face, even at times when I engage in business conversations with people I know are snakes It's like it's a piece of cake, part of the icing is venom Spend a lifetime tryin to bring me down, but I just ain't gonna let 'em You better tell 'em [Chamillionaire] Uhh, I'm back and forth and I'm pacin, bein more patient than patients Tryin to wait for the good news to show up but I'm unfortunately waitin Gotta be group participation if it's in the courts that we makin I was unfortunately done and she was unfortunately fakin Cause the only sexual spark is the spark he got for the dough They say 'til death do us part but that part is where she says no There are too many emotions, emotions like pins and needles Actin like emotions are evil like showin love is illegal I thought that it was a eagle but I seen this vulture befo' He thinks this is where I'll stop cause he sees that I'm walkin slow But no I think you should know that soon as I get where I go You'll remember the fact that I had a purpose for sho' I hope you know where you're goin, I hope you know that today On the side of the road you gon' see a whole lot of snakes When the bad weather comes to rain down on your parade Just raise up your umbrella and try to keep goin straight And keep on goin [Devin the Dude] This road has many curves, many bumps and potholes It can even take you through a loop if you ain't got yo' {shit} together, unpredictable weather could leave you dehydrated, frostbitten, washed away or either ran over by heavy traffic, watch where you roam Cause, it's a challenge just tryin to make it home But, still I walk, I keep my pace, I keep my stride Would hitchhike but there's too much pride I must find a narrow path so I can walk and laugh out loud Choir sing without bein judged by the crowd Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now I just beat my feet and get there someway, somehow And, mile after mile after mile I'll smile Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down And the road gets rough and the journey is long I might get tired but I must move on [Chamillionaire] Most of our heroes are locked up, diseased, or deceased You could never really feel remorse until somebody restin in peace You measure the best by success and ain't impressed by nothin less Only time we say we wanna change is when we ain't got no change left Only time we call on God is when there is nobody else to call Keep stumblin over the same roadblock that just made you fall We always gotta wait 'til somethin happen before we start reactin We at war with ourselves, how much longer are we gon' be attackin? {*rainfall and thunder fades out*} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Chamillionaire Album: Ultimate Victory Song: Ultimate Victory Typed by: trickshady@hotmail.com [Intro] I'ma thank you, when and what the album almost through Thanks, I ain't never had a fan like you Eazy E, Left Eye and Aaliyah too Pac, Biggie, Hawk, Fat Pat and DJ Screw I wanna thank you (Thanks for opening my eyes and helping me to realize That tomorrow ain't promised, Gotta live your life to the fullest What's life if you ain't enjoying it, Know what I'm talking bout?) My purpose really used to be so unclear Science fiction with the swagger, it's so unreal So fly that my nickname should be up here Looking up is the only time when I appear I'm a spartan, go ahead and throw your spear Slap failure in the face and still show no fear They say no show but I show like chea The Champ's here, let the whole crowd know my cheer (Victory!) The media, they write about you in the mags Spread rumors about your life and break you is the task I know one of my three publicists will ruin my chance So let me let you know that I don't like you in advance But I thank you and I extend their thanks too To everybody saying stuff you know ain't true You need to go and find god like Mase too But just stay there with him and try and stay you Getting away is important I can pull a couple strings like a guitar hand Better yet, bring out the whole guitar band Grab grain, you can swang somewhere like Tarzan I swear to y'all, the rap game really making me sick The record industry's your home then I came to prevent Put some nonsense out and I bet cha this one will stick Or put some real music out and I'm probably gonna catch a brick Brick on top of brick, we'll build a house Tell whoever said that, I'm still filled with doubt Told me I'm in the right hole and then sealed it out Told me I'm on the right track and then killed my route Ouch, you never miss a good thing til it's gone Yeah, the flow is so fluid, it's like drinking a song Don't get the track listing wrong, this ain't even a song This is a beat that I must release therapy on Everybody saying that they wanna see me successful Came into the game but now I'm feeling let's go Intimate moments never seem to be special If you jet, then you can bet I'm disappearing like Crisco Ala Kazaam, I ain't mad at the fans I ain't mad at the man, they both scattered my brand Never will understand what really matters to Cham So matter of fact, the title is just a matter of plan (Victory!) After revenge, it's the victory right Well the final run's done and this the victory hype Now that everybody's present and this victory night Let me repaint the pic, they wasn't depicting me right (Now Whatchu mean?) Tell the world that I'm more than just a grill Show you how to put cha hands on more than a wood wheel If that's all you hearing, then let me just be for real Take your contract, the hell with a record deal Keep thinking I'm gonna lose if you want to Been through ten times in life more than you gone through That's why I always have to make the move on fools Back on my feet like I got two gun shoes Yeah, why you think Em probably going all crazy? So why you think Britney Spears going bald baby?

I got cars with curves, treating all my cars like birds The fleet is a flock and the engine starts like "brrr" Welcome to the place where the music is slowed and choppy The writers that wrote about me Said that I wouldn't sell and the major label was gonna drop me I make money moves and the population is sure to copy When I need a favour I'ma call Ben Franklin like I know you got me [Hook] Haters was hating, they thought that I wouldn't last But I'm still on the grind, I can see why they mad Cause I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash) I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash) I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash) I'm still countin' my cash so do the math They knocking my hustle, they saw me coming up fast But I'm still getting mine, can't do nothing but laugh Cause I'm still countin' my cash (uh) I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash) I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash) I'm still countin' my cash so do the math [Verse 2] This is for everyone who be acting like a Grammy made me a winner My hunger did it so do me a favour and make me a dinner Eating cakes at the lima, they gon' hate when you enter Pockets swollen, I'm holding up monkey jeans with suspenders None of these rappers is real, cause if you real then you dodging me Ain't bumped into one that's even halfway as real from what I can see I extend middle finger and don't extend an apology Shows getting me paper, sales getting me property Guess I'm good at monopoly, taking over the game Trynna hold so much paper that my arms and shoulders just stain Ain't smoking or drinking but I'm thinking what being sober will bring You got a hangover in the morning but I'm hanging over in Spain Fifty thousand through customs, I know you isn't accustomed Cause money talks and your pockets look like an end of discussion So hitting my head on the ceiling from money getting is nothing I stand on top of my paper and probably get a concussion I know the...

What is this? Chamillionaire? Not him again.. *Loud sigh* I can't stand him! He's probably name-droppin artists 'cause he knows his album bout to drop You know he's gonna start tryin to diss because he knows he's gonna flop Eff Chamillionaire! That Carter album is what I'm tryna cop Chamillionaire thinks he's too smart, and plus I think he sings a lot See, he is not, nowhere as good as they say he is, I hate that kid! And if he is, how come his last one didn't do as much as this? anyways, you gotta act hard to make it in this music biz And only people who like him is just little white suburban kids Cause he ain't in the streets, he ain't cookin soft, or sellin bricks He can't handle beef, he don't know what a two-time felon is All he talk about is chips, he gotta make a song that's for the chicks That track with Slick - does he think that I could bust a move to this?! H-A-H-A LOL, I SWEAR that boy'll never sell And I just hope he goes to jail, get beat up, stabbed and goes to hell I KNOW he will! I KNOW he will! 'Cause he don't ever show me skill I hope they drop him from his deal, that balla rap is overkill He don't rap the way he used to rap, he rappin 'bout some stupid crap He be rappin without saying *ISH* and I'm not really used to that He don't rap 'bout sippin syrup, he don't rep that Houston rap If I EVER saw him in person, he'd be the rapper that I re-FUSE to dap Anyway, I heard a rumor; he ain't beefin, what a lame! He didn't even diss 50 back when 50 Cent called out his name I asked some girls about him and they told me that they felt the same So many stans on the internet on his dick and it's an eff'in shame I'm loggin on to HipHopDX, like, "Who the heck created this?!" Chamillionaire?! NEGATIVE ONE is what I'm gon' be ratin this He's not the best, I hate this kid, he couldn't even make my list If ANYONE says that this is dope, I SWEAR I'll probably take my fist and punch a hole in this computer, tell the fans to get it straight Cause last time he dropped a hit was nineteen-ninety-NEVER-eight That's the reason why I hate on EVERYONE that says he's great And PLUS he sounds so monotone, his style doesn't ever ELEVATE I logged on SOH-H just to investigate I see he tryna drop a mixtape August 27th, WAIT! Does he think I'ma purchase this? I'd NEVER ever get his tape Anyways, everytime he does, the CD comes out HELLA late And plus The Game is droppin then, he shoulda picked a better date and Texas, they fell off the map, he should be reppin a better state RZA, GZA, Little Brother, and The Cool Kids way better than him and he's not even the best from Texas, he's not even better than Slim I logged on his MySpace page, his song didn't have that many plays {*in whiny voice*}'cause I know that NO ONE cares 'bout ANYTHING he has to say (Time for supper! *knocks on door*) Huh, what?

They just wanna see rainfall (hol' up) They just hope that it's stormin They, always gonna tell you when it rains it pours Mother Nature's cryin inside I know I didn't tell you the entire story But let me finish what happened that night I was chillin with Frank Thomas the baseball player You know the the one that played for the White Sox Uncle Ro and Hurt-M-Badd is how I hooked up with him Thought he could put us in the right spots Let me connect the dots, on the Chi block Had two Cartier rings that was iced out A secretary named Lorraine that was quite hot Told me meet him at the studio, 5 o'clock Tryin to get to the studio Picked up in a limo, I recorded a demo And you know my M.O. H-Town slow it way down, here I picked up the tempo Thought it was a Benz-o, but he wasn't in a Benz-o I hopped out the car and Frank saw me In a parking lot in his Ferrari He opened the door and the leather was lookin Godly Real talk, could've cost a mil' He was back from New York, he had shopped a deal He met with 'em, talked about my appeal All the labels were talkin but not for real Well I think you're wise, and at least ya tried At least we know that they'll see you rise At least you're floatin on decent tires I'm headed home but don't be surprised That's where I'll be if they want me They probably don't but just call me Gave me a couple of stacks because he knew I was headed right back  to the hood, I think it scarred me Then I got on the plane Headed back to Houston like it's part of the game Gave the money to my mother and she couldn't complain Then I headed to the Swishahouse and started a flame Everything started movin up After high school we was cool enough I'm like this ain't got nothin to do with luck I watched Slim and Braceface candy blue a truck The 3-1-2 what I got to dial I called Hurt-M-Badd like, "We got a lot to smile about Hurt, we can make a profit now I need beats cause we 'bout to put an album out" That conversation wasn't friendly Thought he had some beats that he could lend me But he told me that they have a price tag And a beat from him would cost 10 G's That's when my heart turned empty "I wasn't tryin to get 'em free but didn't think that you would rob me I recorded all them songs for you and never asked you for a dollar Now you gonna try to charge me?!" Click! {*dial tone*} On the window pane we can all see the rain Somebody gotta let me know what part of the game is this, wait, now I got a call from Lorraine "Hello?" {*phone rings*} "What's up?" She's no longer workin with Frank at all And told me the reason she made the call is to tell what really happened with the major talk "They liked you Cham and they said you're raw They liked your music but hated all the rest of the artist, he told them 'Nah You wanna sign him? Gotta pay us all'" I knew that I wasn't ever signed to Hurt I knew that I wasn't ever signed to Frank And Frank, he already had a lot of bank I'm never lettin anyone decide my fate Who knew that I would do what I do? Who knew that Michael Watts tried to screw what he screw Who knew that Ron C was good at screwin it too? And how can anybody act like they had a clue? True We wasn't sittin by a stewardess You wasn't ridin on the tour bus, and it was more than a few of us I couldn't tell you where the jeweler was But I could tell you where the sewer was Labels was pursuin us, switch back to Chicago Where everybody duck five-oh And pimps ride fly though They say "In God we trust" but keep a weapon in the Bible He said "What it look like Joe?" He was puffin on a green leaf In the foreign with the cream seats Matter of fact it was black, he was in the streets knee-deep Now he the manager for Chief Keef ... Wait, that's Uncle Ro! The one who used to take me to the studio The one that used to tag everything we drove We both somehow made some major dough, whoa Fast-forward, the man with the curry We could've sold out to the change in a hurry I wouldn't have an AMG Benz at 30 I probably woulda never ever made "Ridin' Dirty" And now they wanna see my +Reign Fall+?

rent I hog the lane, listen how my horn be oinking My diamonds got more points, than a point guard pointing I'm badder than some sun glasses, better cover your eyes I drive fast jaws drop, and eye brows rise I hold it down like Sprint, mouth looking like gold bricks Looking like stalagmites, hanging off my lips I had aspirations of balling, ever since I was six My record's like mosquito bites, every DJ wants to itch it Every time people staring, and pow wow mix They call a ambulance, to help em get they face on fix [Hook] [Chamillionaire] When it come to riding chrome, we some veteran pros

in God we trust But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch They got my purple people eater once, the next day I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch [Hook] [Trae] When I flip in my slab, I'm fin to beat they back off like I was legs Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished I'm bout to diminish these

pimping, 84 tipping all through the South Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking But not today, cause Trae gon be flipping on top of his game We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me mayn When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the
