The main goal's to achieve, to succeed Have it laid out for your seed But the world gets colder every day by day Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A. Trying to find piece of mind is like tryin to find a gold mine It just won't happen, no time for relaxin Real soldiers of fortune the front line of the action  So never show a nigga what you packin (You know what I'm sayin?) It's too much weight to be jugglin who do you picture when you think about strugglin Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin Or niggaz in the E-class heavy drug smugglin Movin...yeah!  yes movin... At the speed of life [Verse Two] And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes But nowadays the blind just follow the blind And when I die, niggaz still recite these lines to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down  the underground! to upper echelon and beyond Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond Nigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blonde bitch Mackin to Farrakhan, run game like a marathon It's here today then tomorrow it's gone It's the law of the land, a straight modern day babylon!

Shilo Harris Album: Napalm Song: Meaning of Life Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com  [Intro: Ret. Staff Sgt. Shilo Harris] My name is Staff Sergeant Shilo Harris, retired United States Army. Unfortunately while serving our nation, I was hit with a roadside bomb that was estimated about 800 pounds of explosives. I lost three soldiers, my truck was destroyed. My driver and I were the only two soldiers out of that vehicle that survived. [Chorus: Xzibit] So what's the meanin of life? What's the meanin of life? Man I don't know, I don't know Cause all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage Grand larceny cause I'm stealin the show What's the meanin of life? What's the meanin of life? Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya All I know is if you spend too much time without bein refined Then your life will be described as a failure [Xzibit] Let me tell you 'bout these bitch-ass, half-cocked, pussy ass niggaz that's never gon' pull a trigger to protect no figures Never seen a hard time in your life Beatin the shit out of your kids and your wife, cause what you lack in a fight That we all fightin is similar, self-hate and mutilation The lost angel, Los Angeles, congratulations From admiration to aggravation to the highest level Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle Heart colder than gun metal, I done survived it all Prayin for my downfall, got the fuck from around y'all No more niggaz bringin me down, even includin myself I celebrate life for nobody else Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health Momentum shrouded in stealth Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fell for the dollar Now watch Xzibit rise to power I turned these 15 minutes to hours; but still askin [Chorus] - without "So" at the start [Xzibit] Let me tell you 'bout these hypocrites and half-wits, caught up in the politics Work yourself to death but Uncle Sam is takin all of it Prisoner to the policy, the mark of the beast Becomin one with technology, surveillance of each And every one of us, some of us got no heart and no backbone The few will seek freedom while most of the masses will conform That woman you lust for is usually not the one that stick around when you go to war, immaculate platform We back and prepared for 'em, attackin the landlords Cause the shit too high, we 'bout to get what we came for! And if I should die, may it not be in vain, more importantly more to see; keep it crackin and orderly Got my future in front of me, focus is fuckin phenomenal Nobody can touch us, I turned the impossible possible with it, do me a favor man, do not try to tell me shit It's just me and my bitch, yeah [Chorus] - without "So" at the start [Interlude: Ret. Staff Sgt. Shilo Harris] When I was injured, I had sustained 35% burns over my body. I lost my ears, my nose, and have been through many reconstructive surgeries. My father was there, my wife was there, my children. That was a lot of my motivations  because I knew the way that they were looking at me, I had to get stronger. I had to become independent again, and I think that that's why I pushed so hard. [Xzibit] Let me tell you 'bout these long days and sleepless nights Penny-pinchin tryin to make it to the afterlife And not to mention time is short, you better make it right Before you see that final light get all yo' business tight This is the gospel, gotta get it or get left alone So get it on until yo' destiny is set in stone The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death So make it count and live yo' life out loud with no regrets This for the set, this for the ones that's never wakin up Live in a fantasy, insanity, they fake as fuck They outta touch, they outta line, it's time to face the truth That I wasn't supposed to make it, now I'm livin proof Excavated mountains of misery, eventually found the fountain of youth It's been pissed in, shit in, violated so they pollute That's why they shoot, have yo' ass in a box dressed in a suit 'Bout time you got in touch with your roots, yeah [Chorus] - first 1/2 [Outro: Ret. Staff Sgt. Shilo Harris] The best help that you can do, is help yourself. You have to, to step up. You have to find the strength inside of you to pull yourself through it because y'know you can, you can have people pull you every day. But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward then you're gonna be stuck in a rut. And you're gonna be stuck in that bad place that is depressing and holding you back. The only person that can set you free is yourself.

Trapped in infatuation (really)? Back up off me Kiss my ass. Then wake up n' smell the coffee See, when you're broke and unknown, your baby's mama clown you Your family down's you.

It takes a thief Here's everything you need to know about the record industry,  like a chief. 'Cause labels is doing $300,000 deals;  Blowing coke smoke up my ass, but we both know crack kills.

MC's get the pussy and fame. Brothers essex floss with a corporate card  and charge it to the rappers name But the label owners make all the real money Just ask David Geffrey, Barry Gordy, Russel, or Puffy (ching, ching!) Business? You don't get what you deserve. You negotiate And everything is renegotiable based on the sales you generate But hip-hop fans don't buy albums, and, then again, tend to player hate The rapper that went Pop. But before this, I never knew Skills don't pay the mother fucking bills. Money do Is you stupid? How nice I represent don't pay rent The R&B ho who jock Theo on the radio buy your CD doe. Rap magazines be screaming they keep it real but keep it fake on the cover Pulling tennis shoe and clothing advertisements. No wonder Like Common "I Used to Love H.E.R."
