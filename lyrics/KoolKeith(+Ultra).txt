[voice] Proceed to explain the sound of music When it{?} zaps from space [Kool Keith] The pitch is controlled, distortion is corrected All tweeters are jumpin, the bass is injected Equal meters are movin, the beat just groovin The tune is amplified, music breakin the vibe As I talk, amazing soul, come out your stereo In a three-dimension swirl, this groove'll twirl Circulating through your ear, sort apart you hear Likewise to surprise, or even otherwise To boom your system loud, and boldly equalize With monitors reading, the power you're receiving Your output's kickin while time is just tickin At a maximum pace with class and taste All elements converge, to roughly emerge As a soul mechanism, tough expressionism To prove a man's mind, there's knowledge then wisdom Kool Keith I stand, here to rule and command! [voice] Yes I see, but can you further enhance my understanding of that last question [Ced Gee] The mix real cold, the rhymes are complacent When the atmosphere is dense, the sounds are compression All the levels are movin, with us just zoomin The mix is Gemini, soundtrack make you realize That as I speak must be deep my force is at it's peak Ten thrills per second, this formula's injectin Vibrating through your brain, sorta strange deranged Likewise to arrive and be, immortalized To choose your designation and boldly energize With sensor readings, the message you're receiving Your accents kickin while your bass keeps hitting At a minimum rage with an order restrained All power circuits surge, then roughly diverge Choose brain functionisms, work with mechanisms To simplify all science, rules with definitions Ced Gee at his peak, information never weak! [voice] Hmm, so then let this track be called HA HA HA HA HA HA HA... (Space Space Space Space Space Groove) (Space Space Space Space Space Groove) [voice] As a space MC What kind of powers do you posess? [Kool Keith] Well they call me Kool Keith, the lady's relief No alias rapper, or Vulcan chief Now hocus, pocus, bring your mind in further Cause I'm a wizard to abolish, disappear astonish As I move beyond space, the clocks hear the bass While the Earth motivates, spins and rotates My mind innovates, absorbs and dominates Every typical brain, drained with no complain At a radius measure extemporize pleasure To phase interchange, evidently strange Transmit it to a form, some heat to make it warm Throw vapor in the air, produce a thunderstorm With effective material, beamin through your stereo At orbital speeds information to feed Seven words per second, the mega force is wreckin On a voyage to discover and wipe out any other! [voice] Yes - but how does HE use his powers? [Ced Gee] As I orbit through space, my rhymes set the pace My mind concentrates, consumes then innovates Multi-celled membranes, trained to be insane Make symbolically fresh, yes to impress Expand at range, more and never less So rapid with thrust, I'm here to brain crush All toy perpetrators, social mind invaders Reduced to nothin, because they just bluffin In a sense, to convince, I'm here, in great suspense At a warp factor seven, returning you TO HEAVEN [voice] So I see, so I see AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

I'm not smoking blunts, or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt. I left New York, the city itself was stress depression High boots and urban beats, that wasn't my direction Producers filtering join in with R&B A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core All I saw was Kool Keiths on my thaw Record companies had G'd-off all my royalties Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap Karl Kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limosines Mixtapes by wack DJ's adds doo doo play I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion On videos out of town, peoples buy confusion Rolling high with cash pulled over down my eye Since I've been out, y'all can't see Chorus:  Is the world made of plastic?

Jacuzzi and everything, big radio advertisement The alternative promoter uses weeklies and internet Is a little strict, scared to spend, usually out of billions The ones that do raves, go out baller style Brand new clubs, new mics, also travel to and from But others messed it up so it don't drop the same Has sense to crease, they cuttin it They also cut into the rap game for low prices on artists the hustler promoter already treated well, sometimes tricky The roach promoter, wants you to pay your own travel Does not even have SHIT together, no transportation Runner, a small cheap venue, usually holes in the wall Don't have a liquor license Wants to book you, with 20 acts for five hundred bucks Still uses flyers in Motel 6's, and Travelodges When you see a guy with a tiny Volkswagen goin back and forth pickin up a known artist up, from the airport Most of the time a rejected whack rapper don't fuck with 'em!
