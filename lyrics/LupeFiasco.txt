they poker with the devil And our moon littened ghetto Hello my name stickers on the stickers of the veins In rehab remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow When they was on back of a nickel like Monticello When the underworld had to be smarter than Donatello No honor amongst fellows It's harder than sitting with a blind man and trying to describe yellow Got me feeling like killer Joe My life the album Know the classics by heart and exactly how the filler go Repeat it on my way to the liquor store, chocolate [Second Verse] Cause I can't feel the field niggas chains Though I covet mine, so I covered mine in bling Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame Then I bumped into a hon and uncovered mine again Diamonds been under minded mayne, they give a nigga with no mack another kind of game See money talks in another kind of slang Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire as I accept the call And listen to the life of Getting religion and making voodoo in the sink of your cell Reciting Al-Fatiha in the kitchen In deed on his deem and in addition to doing dishes Listen as I get schooled on the rules to rule Fuel of fools, the obstacles, the

When this song come on in the club, do you feel it? When a racist shows you love, do you feel it? When he know he won't win the game, do he feel it? When a preacher is driven insane, do he feel it? Every time I write a rhyme, do I feel it? When Im running out of time, will I feel it? When the liquor is poured on the ground, do they feel it? If my music didn't make a sound, would you feel it?

I love me more I love the peace And I love the war I love the seas And I love the shore No love for no beach Baby, that's loyal But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil I trick, I fall Run up in raw I love her, with all my heart Every vein, every vessel Every bullet lodged With every flower that I ever took apart She said- that she would give me greatness Status, placement above the others My face would grace covers Of the magazines of the hustlers Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams The purpose of our scene The obscene obsession for the bling She would be my queen I could be her king Together, she would make me cool And we would both rule, forever And I would never feel pain And never be without pleasure, ever, again And if the rain stops And everything's dry She would cry Just so I can drink the tears from her eyes She'll teach me how to fly Even cushion my fall If my engines ever stall And I plummet from the sky But she will keep me high And if I ever die She would commission monuments on her bosom To hum Or maybe she'd retire as well A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell And I'll be The Coolest nigga what The

love her (do I love her) Said I don't know Streets got my heart, Game got my Soul One times my sunshine will never hurt ya soul Quote to a client dishonored baby momma Whose the momma to the daughter That I had fathered from afar My new lady gave a mercedes And a necklace with a solid gold key Like the starter of a car, the opener of a door Or two pounds of raw You gave me a baby, but what about lately Then ha ha ha ha ha, right up in her face G There's more fish in the sea I'm on my mission to be The Coolest nigga what The Coolest nigga what The Coolest nigga what The Coolest nigga what Lord

Now the city looks less bright, Brooklyn looking less special Don't carry the same weight as when you were on this level You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless An inspiration and a king They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring Protect it with every feather on the wings So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing [Chorus: Jane] Said it's a cold cold war And nobody wins like the government in the U.S.S.R. Cause it's another plachette, nobody cares who you think you are And you can fight it, but there's no defense for what things are Baby grab a jacket, it's a cold cold war [Lupe Fiasco] Let me clarify the chorus And what my cold war is Cause the complexity is enormous Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets To reinforce every single word that I talk with Something about losing things, human beings That reduces things to their most elementary Find yourself where you never meant to be With the energy of memories That's the soul force of what's behind killing me Finding pleasure in the pains Like finding desert in the rain Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic Question if I'm over it Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it Still happy that I opened it [Lupe Fiasco] In the studio writing these words, one after another In memorial of my brother As you listen to the album with Nothing on the cover I imagine that he hovers In the back of his chair Floating right there in the air Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it Ask why do I put myself through this Crack a smile, look up at the file The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross Happy with his dedicated song But now he's all gone But he was never there, cause He was everywhere, nowhere and down here Maybe on that judgement day, rise up We'll both open our eyes up, climb up Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies Wipes away our cool young histories The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lupe Fiasco f/ Jason Evigan Album: Food & Liquor II - The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 Song: Unforgivable Youth Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Intro/Chorus: Jason Evigan] This world, my heart, my soul Things that I don't know The icicles they grow They never let me go Scars are left as proof But tears they soak on through Things I've done My young My unforgivable youth [Lupe Fiasco] With land on the horizon & passion in their eyes then What they think are islands are much more in their size Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them Now steadily declining Return is not an option as necessity denies them With this they choose to dive in Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure Not the material things of kings that could never last forever But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever And stuck up on a pike up along the beach Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs And so began it here, and for five hundred years Torture, terror, fear 'til they nearly disappear [Lupe Fiasco] Ways and means from the trade of human beings A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine And helps the new regime establish and expand Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land From native caretakers who can barely understand How can land be owned by another man. Warns "One can not steal what was given as a gift Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish?" But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed You kill but do not eat it The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it The forests's were cleared, the factories were built And all mistakes will be repeated by your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement And then you rush to have the most, from the day you left your boats You'll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts [Lupe Fiasco] As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the East A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep They discover ancient cars on even older streets And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth They can tell that they were civil, not barbaric in the least A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall They would doubt that there was any starvation at all That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade Everything's so organized, they had to be well behaved Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies Religions kinda complex, kinda hard to figure out And this must be the temple, this White House The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Lupe Fiasco Album: Food & Liquor II - The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 Song: Hood Now (Outro) Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Lupe Fiasco] This one's for the hood!

I ... I ... I ... [Verse 1: Ghostface Killah] Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller This about a young boy dealing with the older fellas Promised him the lives you see on TV He ran packs across town like rhyme CD's And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks Stacking too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box Saving, he promised his mom a crib in Atlanta And his pops got killed in debt, he was a gambler So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases No more cross-town, now he's crossing them states and Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust So when the door kicked open they scream "This is a bust" "Is it a set up?", it seems funny, a scuffle broke out He got hit, dropped the cases spitting blood out of his mouth He walked four blocks to die trying to survive And now all that's left is his mom screaming "God Why?"

I ... [Verse 2: Mike Shinoda] Yeah, yeah, let me begin by saying "Shut the fuck up!" Let my begin by saying I don't think this man knew what he had in store He opened the door and found the bag under the floor Not a peep, always working a lot, get the flame, aim, pop Open the box and take off out the back of the pawn shop Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car He felt like he been hustling so hard like a demon he pumped a cold heart Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart, put the rings on his chain attached by both parts He did the drop, one ring in a bag, envelope, all the money he had Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail In the box was a bullet made of gold Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band And he stared at it sitting in the palm of his hand And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand It was his wife in the picture on his side With the ring on the finger on the week that she died As he looked in the reflection, at those eyes so red He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head Like that [Chorus:Lupe Fiasco] Uh, spraypaint and ink pens I use to write in every color I think in To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I ... I ... I ... I ... [Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco] He know he didn't have enough power in his thrusters to muster Warp 5 Plus if he pushed it the fuel cells could rupture then they would die Then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try But he couldn't risk it, put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it And told her goodbye, she started to cry, but he knew if he could distract 'em He could buy her some time and she could make it out alive Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off Space mine had blew one of the hands off Damaged laser cannons and the guiding system jamming And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth The final saga in the seven planet wars Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like [Chorus:Lupe Fiasco]	 Uh, spraypaint and ink pens I use to write in every color I think in To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I ...

Woke up to a note saying "the world did this to me" Now I'm testing, one two, reporting live from the rubble Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you One, two, three, four, five models on the double Give me head all at once, look like they line in a huddle But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine, you know I love you Shedding tears every day, and I'm tired of lying in these puddles I ask why sometimes like a fucking vowel Been hitting trees every day like a fucking owl Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds of the +Phoenix Sun+ to Nash it out, I mean ash it out So I could see you smile, I-I know you can see me now The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page   Warning : include(/home/ohhla/www/anonymous//kan_west/late_ref/touchsky.wst.txt) [ function.include ]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/ohhla/public_html/files/lyrics.php on line 67   Warning : include() [ function.include ]: Failed opening '/home/ohhla/www/anonymous//kan_west/late_ref/touchsky.wst.txt' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php') in /home/ohhla/public_html/files/lyrics.php on line 67
