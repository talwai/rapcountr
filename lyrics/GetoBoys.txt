And if she ain't suckin' That's a waste of time conversation and my fuckin' I'll just put my fuckin pants on And tell the idiotic freak to take her tramp ass home! You see I don't need a dumbie! I need a bitch to like nuts until my dick is coming And after this she'll earn her glow Just call me the gangster of love. I like bitches All kinds of bitches, To take off my shirt  and pull down my britches If she has big tities  I'll squeeze them and hold'em  As she sucks my dick and licks my scrotum If she's got another friend then I'll fuck her too Together we can play a game of swi-cha-ru I ain't the type who gets all mushy I like to sit back  and watch them eat each other's pussy!

Six different hoes a night I use lubricated rubbers To make the pussy feel right Better to be safe than be a vicitm I put the pussy in its place Before I nut  I pull it out into the face And tell the bitch to keep licking And prepare herself for another ruthless dicking And when I'm done--straight to the tub Just call me the gangster of love. I'm a mutherfucker I put a bitch through a test.  If she don't pass, she don't get blessed! If the test consist of  fuckin my whole crew Bitch, goddamnit that's what you gotta do.

He says, "I'm sorry, Ak, don't kill me, I was jokin, griff" That's why your boys are on my balcony and they're frozen stiff The boy was shocked, then pulled up cops, he looked at me said, "You're a goner Cause you shot and killed the boys who worked my corner" Pulled back the hammer, put my gun up almost point blank Shattered his dome, reached in the pocket, took the boy's bank Got out the Cadillac, the copper, he said, "Stop it, freeze!" I aim my pistol for his stomach, instead I pop his knees Fell to the floor, he looked at me and he said, "Akshun, please!" I put my gun between his eyes, said, "Don't breathe" He took a breath, and he knew he'd breathe his last breath That's 20 soldiers and copper, 21 shot to death I had to leave everything I'd ever worked for  But best believe, I won't get sentenced for a drug war But maybe one day in the future I can come back But until then, I'm goin home, where I'm from, black Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face And ask my posse, they say, "We call him Scarface" Hey Conjo, mayn, listen to me, mayn Now that we got Texas fiendin, mayn It's time to make the whole fuckin world start geekin We expand across the whole muthafuckin world, mayn And we get the dope out there, mayn We fuck em up!

He packs a beeper, drives a Beemer, and he's only 19 Yo let's harass him, to see what he's got What started off as a game ended the lives of 2 cops Life in the fast lane Another hot spot, you screech to a halt Yo look what I've got, then reach for the wall They find the product, and the cops'll say OHHHHHHH~! They'll put your butt in the bump Roll to the station, yo captain whassup? I caught this brother on the cut, we gotta lock this boy up Straight to the jail cell, no 9 or a clip And the ones you triple-crossed'll want revenge so get hip Out in an hour, on your way to the pad A copper starts to trail you, now you're sweatin bad Turn on his flashers, you stop Tommy Tucker He stuck his head in the window so you shot him like a sucker Fell to the pavement, blood pourin on the cement There's witnesses standin by and you knew that he seen it Back on the run again, and the boys on your block was blabbin all to the cops about the people you shot Did you get nervous, well why continue your route? When you know that normal folks don't chill with blood on their suits Took off his jacket, flung to the back Grabbin a pull from the pack, I gotta break I get back Right to his rock spot, before the brother got shot He tried to sell 2 ki's to Tony that was filled full of sheet rock Bumped off~! They ain't let him slide Now his family's tryin to figure out the reason he died ... But that's the name of the game Way he died was a shame, pushin 'caine ... ... Life in the fast lane I remember fast times, sellin dope was my pasttime Life in the fast lane, while countin cash I'd sit back and wonder, what would become of me The fiends would see the Beemer comin, and then they'd run to me Step out the vehicle, yo what you need Joe? I need a 20 and a nickel bag of weed bro Make the sale then I'd bail out Now it's time to get the hell out Every day was the same thing, dopefiends named me Big Crack Ak cause I sold 'caine mainly Out of the big I had the biggest rocks on the block, so check it out yo money dig this It was the purest in the rock form, the only way I sell it No cuts, uh-uh, no B-12 to swell it I got lucky made it out of the game ...

He says, "I'm sorry, Ak, don't kill me, I was jokin, griff" That's why your boys are on my balcony and they're frozen stiff The boy was shocked, then pulled up cops, he looked at me said, "You're a goner Cause you shot and killed the boys who worked my corner" Pulled back the hammer, put my gun up almost point blank Shattered his dome, reached in the pocket, took the boy's bank Got out the Cadillac, the copper, he said, "Stop it, freeze!" I aim my pistol for his stomach, instead I pop his knees Fell to the floor, he looked at me and he said, "Akshun, please!" I put my gun between his eyes, said, "Don't breathe" He took a breath, and he knew he'd breathe his last breath That's 20 soldiers and copper, 21 shot to death I had to leave everything I'd ever worked for  But best believe, I won't get sentenced for a drug war But maybe one day in the future I can come back But until then, I'm goin home, where I'm from, black Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face And ask my posse, they say, "We call him Scarface" Hey Conjo, mayn, listen to me, mayn Now that we got Texas fiendin, mayn It's time to make the whole fuckin world start geekin We expand across the whole muthafuckin world, mayn And we get the dope out there, mayn We fuck em up!

Then I sat back and relaxed As they sixty-nined, and ate each other's cat I dropped them off at home God damn, look at this shit, my wallet's gone!

Diggin deep into my mind, you understand I came up with a dope-ass master plan Thinkin while I sip on a 40 I got it! I'ma throw myself a private party I called up one, and said, "Whassup? What's goin on?" She said, "Nuthin much" I said, "Hey, I got a very close friend, who wants to meet cha She thinks you're pretty, and from what I told her, she too" She thought about it and said, "Cool, it's on" Pick me up at eight -- then I hung up the phone I called up the other, dropped a little know-how Kicked it to her smoooooth, that other level style Then I dropped the second step of my plan Asked her had she ever been with two men, or a woman and man? ("Say what?") It's just a question, I'm not out to diss you She said, "Yeah baby it's cool, but yo, I'm heterosexual" She was frontin man, trust me Cause she's the type of hoe who like to taste her own pussy When we're fuckin she takes the dick out, licks it all over then she puts it in her mouth Now after doin that type of shit She could be talkin the other things REAL quick I said, "I got another friend, I wanna party with and we can all get into the hot tub and have a little bit of fun You know baby? Hahaha! Consider this a test and if you pass you'll be my number one" She said, "Okay it's a date I gotta make a few runs, so pick me up at eight" "Huh, better make it eight thirty! Give me some time to wash up,  and take a bath because I'm kinda dirty" Before she hung up the phone, I said, "Wait! If you wasn't special to me, I wouldn'ta invited you on the date" She said, "Yeah, I know - I love you see you later" Things are gettin good but in the end they'll be much greater .. Pick em up, then I make em feel comfortable Crackin jokes, as if I was Cliff Huxtable Get into the crib, things are hype Fix em a couple of drinks, to get their heads right but not too much cause I don't wanna make em woozy Thirty minutes later, let's jump into the jacuzzi One said, "I didn't even bring a swimsuit" The other said, "Don't worry about it - ain't nobody gonna bite you; cause I don't have one either.." The shit was gettin dope! I had to take a breather Step into the water and it's showtime I'm a nigga -- so I GOTS to go for mine But the key's to have patience But with two of the finest girls in the world, who wouldn't be anxious? But I kept my cool, grinnin like a devil Know I'm bout to put these two bitches on that other level Hayeah yeah yeah, I'm just your typical horny little devil .. I make them both suck on my chest like Mr. Slick Then I took one's head, and pushed it down to the dick Now I got one on the dick, one on the nipples Squeezin on they asses, the shit is so simple! Then another smooth move real quick I pushed the other bitch's head down to the dick Now they're suckin on my dick like a lollipop In and out of each other's mouth, when will they ever stop? Oooh! Suckin on my pole; and while they suckin on my pole  I'm runnin my fingers through their pussyholes Then back up to the chest again - YES! Everything is cool, cause I'm the best my friend Now they're lickin on my chest, my nipples rather die Jimmy pushed both of their heads together Now they kissin one another - oooh!

black troop Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under But everyone knows that every day's a different number So when your time comes, just remember, G You'll always have a place in this world as a memory Especially my boys who passed away back in '92 Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin Of how we hung in the clubs

Everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death Another killin was reported on the evenin news Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes In the midst of all this shit I think about myself Wonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf But I refuse to be another violent casualty So when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee Cause on the city streets

that was it The whole entire family spoke on his defense The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce And durin all the singin I broke down myself When I looked and seen the family that my partner left And then the choir broke into its final song Thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come Everyone was headed for the final flight As we creeped along the gravel on the burial site The director said his words and there was not a sound As they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top And then they work alone with the concrete block And that's deep [ VERSE 4: Big Mike ] A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry I watch tears fall down from their eyes Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance They chose the music, so they had to dance Couldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it Got caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game We used to kick it on the ave at night Comin up tryin to have the finer things in life But now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home I wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the clone So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten So long, remember whenever or wherever Dead or alive,

Ooh shit, I woke up on the wrong side of bed today Looking for some homo sapiens to slay Lost in panic thoughts, frantic killings now I'm sought But I give a fuck, fool, I'm the hunter not the hunted Bushwick's the name, Geto Boy executioner Terminator, murder revolutioner Street stalker cause of a metamorphosis Late night rapes, bodies found in the forest No clues left behind, a fool from the dark side Continious killings, many unsolved homicides No ordinary kid got a top of no ????? Kidnapped his kid like permanently dispossessed The controversy falls around Bushwick the Hacksaw Command planned slayings with no flaws...

[Seagram] Deranged thoughts fill my head as I lay in bed Satanic killings brings misery and dread Pentagram symbol printed in my right palm Silence is wisdom and sane but I remain calm Mental ????? ????? ????? ????? ????? Chained down in my basement for a pathophysical torture Caucasians and asians are joining my concentration Satan persuaded outstanding termination... For moding path, sacraficing souls, swinging bold with an axe I attempt to apprehend but she was cautious Late walks and stalks leaves the murders often Killed the person, stabbed from my hellbound pitchfork Walked on the path of Satan, come on and come forth What's ya began? You are my sin but to comprehend... You are counted for your actions, the wages of sin... [Bushwick Bill] Listen up my brothas and sistas...Look, listen, observe...

It's a day of emancipation, but everybody wonder why Willie ain't celebrating. But things ain't perfect. I'm looking beyond the surface. So instead of drinking beer, and playing Dominoes, I'm sitting in the room with my eyes closed. (chorus - K-Rino - some Jamaican) White man and the mental yet ta black ol'shade,  White man and the mental yet ta blacd ol'shade? For tellin' black mon no matta the dum'smarta rich If the matta mo'mon jus a white mon's bitch De givin us crack to let the ghetto people Coming to the problem of the world, blaming racial discrimination when they fuckin' up the self, Willie D slap the thigh, and K-Rino crack despise black mon get the government dick out ya eyez  (Willie D) Follow me now, see, as I get a little deeper,  they think I'm a drug dealer, 'cause I wear a beeper. But if I wasn't black, and I talked all proper,  they probably think I was a doctor. I try to have the finest things in life, but when I get'em, they say I'm not living right. They search my house and car for no reason, like it's muthafuckin' goddamn nigga season. And it is when U think about it, they hurt yo'ass, treat U like an animal, and bragg about it. It's like a cop turnin' vicious as a 12-gauge no wonder why he gets his picture on the front page. Now even if you're light, and damn near white, you'll get smoked, B-cuz yo' in the same boat tryin' to surround yourself with white folks in your video, like Paula Abdul she's a silly ho. Although U only might be one-percent black troop,  they still consider you a mook. But she say's she ain't black, so how da'FUCK she figga?. Yo bitch, u still a nigga. (chorus - K-Rino - some Jamaican I imagine???) Government broke in my house with they guns so they busin' and breakin' cos' they paid to no one Now they have a murder rap and they makin no stros so I'm facin' incarceration in the police station, There wasn't a bitch or a wicked assassin since they comment homicide offering to tend protection resist conviction  cos the shot from da'honest white mon now to hear some muthafuckin run.  (Willie D) True niggas retaliate, they don't run. I say we niggas 'cos they treat us like scum. So get a nose job like Michael Jackson  Go to a white school, and change your accent. U STILL A NIGGA, so how da'fuck U figga  since U moved out da'neighborhood, and datin' a peckerwood, that you're different from the rest of the clan. Tryin' to get a job, and count how many doors slam. Goddamn, I'm on a row. I can't forget about my bald head hoes To some, it's a fashion, to wear weave and pony tails,  but the other hoes wanna be white girls. Whodini said "Be Yourself, Trooper," U don't see white folks tryin' to act BLACK do ya. So why U laughin' at the brotha in dreads, u neet to get the chemicals out yo'own motherfuckin' heads!
