I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me!

Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked hell The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold! Both of our tempers were on swolle For the most part you fuss, fight, fart! You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign! [Chorus:] [Verse 3:]  K-O, knocked out by technicality The love has kissed the canvas Now the whole family is mad at me My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing I think he's pissed! I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue Now the energy is coming back Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CDs Baby please, you make me want to scream! You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? Tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream! You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?

bad seeds Please, any man can ask, to get a pass or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel Talk to the coach or break out the huddle

Sisters at the crib knowing (from this point on it only gets rougher!) Preachers at the church knowing, we still get by (from this point on it only gets rougher!) Teachers at the school knowing (from this point on it only gets rougher!) Ladies on the block knowing (from this point on it only gets rougher!) Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high (from this point on it only gets rougher!) [Big Boi] Well here's a formal introduction Something to make you ponder The situation's ugly, like "In Living Color"'s Wanda (word up!) Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk you took Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag Now that's ass backwards All you got in the refrigertator is bratwurst Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life right? Your dignity, your only sacrifice, slim as your chances of being somebody's wife They seeing ya butt, booty naked every night, ain't nothing right or wrong! [Hook] [Big Boi] Even though things started falling apart Wanda went and bought a Honda Now she's out of a job, she would slob on a knob For a little less than a yard, a massage you could drill her like a sarge She would charge and rob Pick through yo' pockets She got the tricks watcha nd the silver locket That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license On the night stand fuckin' with this white man She met in a little red Corvette paid for sex Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet Every action has a positive and equal reaction Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion Fast and furiously, the was a knock on the sliding glass door (bitch, it's me!) You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick But you slipped now I'm getting in your shit!!!!

Yo senses heighten, reflexes sharpen vision's enhanced adrenaline flows as they rush across the street you leave the print from the heater grip in yo palm then yo heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just goin' to the store. Many of us mistake Phobia for true fear. Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation. Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence. Through stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification they'll turn your fear switch to a permanent on. We can change this by changing the small truth within' the lie. Death is a small price to pay for respect. Death is a small price to pay for respect. You know who it is. You know what it is. Peace out.

Red pipe and leather; slick nasty Sassy, but at the same time raspy Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster [Andre 3000] Styles will change. They say change is dang-erous As a King standing on the terrace While his partner pointing up at the riflemen Coward shooter, never know when your life will end Then live like there ain't no 'morrow And if one come then this the motto Now I put message in bottle You go to the nearest beach and open your car door And walk to the place where the sea meets the land Yeah, it's easier to run the street than walk in the sand Hey, I'm talking young man. As if chalk in my hand I will take y'all little ass to school It's cool when the kids call me Sunny, the hood calls me Stacks The B's call me honey, Hollywood calls me back Crack and I have a lot in common We both come up in the 80's and we keep that bass pumping That's a nega-tive comparison, embarrassing Unfortunate that if you come up fortunate the streets consider you lame Ha, I thought the name of the game was to have a better life. I guess it ain't. What a shame I don't slang. Never slung but I'm one with the slum that has a name well fitting Plenty cheese getting. No wonder why they call it the trap So watch your tail and I'm not kidding The rats and mice will give advice, they say, "you can paint and draw Get out of here. Go show them that we're more than slanging raw." That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression And I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson  That the morals that you think you got go out the window When all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis And your child is down on her knees praying hard up to God for a whopper with cheese Do you B) hit the street hard with a flair  Or do you A) go to school for heating and air? Dare make an honest living or make a crooked killing Or do a bit of both until you're holding on a million? Brilliant. You got one foot in, one foot out You put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about You do the hokey pokey til you turn your life around That's what it's all about. 3000 out The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Outkast f/ Sleepy Brown, Snoop Dogg Album: So Fresh, So Clean 12" Song: So Fresh, So Clean (Remix) Typed by: sergio@miapimps.com [Sleepy Brown] Outkast, Snoop Dogg, Sleepy Brown Ching-a-Ling, the ride is on me, cuz Ching-a-Ling, we're so fresh so clean Ching-a-Ling, we always make a seen, cuz we'ere Ching-a-Ling, so fresh so clean Ching-a-Ling, I been doin things now Ching-a-Ling, so fresh so clean Ching-a-Ling, the light stays green now Ching-a-Ling, so fresh so clean [Sleepy Brown] Here I am, you know it's me The focused-out brotha with the pinky ring People stare, women scream Cuz they never seen a brotha be so clean Gangstah hats, minks to match Glass half full just sippin now Big Snoop Dogg bout to fuck you up Me and Outkast just lay in the back In the Cadillac, grill intact Purple-blue gators, and belts to match [Andre 3000] (Sleepy Brown) Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane It doesnt matter (play in the rain) we always play in the rain Too much of data can make the mind overload Scramble all logic not even you can decode (Where are we going, can we slip and we slide?)

The hood needs funds There's a war going on and half the battle is guns How dare I throw it on the floor When people are poor So I write like Edgar Allen to restore Got a cord, umbilical, attached to a place that can't afford No landscaping or window draping This old lady told me if I ain't got nothing good, say nay-thing That's why I don't talk much. I swear it don't cost much To pay attention to me I tell it like it is and then I tell it how it could be The hood be requesting my services Oh, don't get nervous it's Step your game up time.

Cupcake her; I didn't bother She's a follower; a hell of a swallower not a leader Got a first, second, third and fourth string. I didn't need her I didn't mean to treat her like she was the main feature presentation Her just a traitor to these situations More like a hassle because she had no keys to the castle The queen sits on the throne while this hoe rides down Old National Zoom. Go ahead hoe and beat your feet Dr-dr, drop down and get your eagle on freak We ever so discrete with this meat Got a whole lot to lose if paparazzi ever shot or shoot we Meaning me and you. Us together and the lens My 'ins would be gone just like some dro in the wind Told the hoe, "You going to win. Sure enough we going to pretend To the land of make believe. Now come on and hit this hen." Taking shots to the neck Now that's love in your mou-outh now we're affiliates So don't give me the gangster grill. No drama.
