And all of a sudden I'm telling you, and I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway And there's no expression on it And I think just after a point I'm just talkin gto lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said "yes" or "no" yet And regrettably I end up using the word, "destiny" I don't remember in what context - doesn't really matter Before long I'm out of stuff to say And you smile and say, "okay" I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment but there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus So I pretend like I'm asleep, and before long I really am I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on I turn and you're not there Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore We're parked at the pick-up point which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church The bus is half empty You might be in your dad's car by now your bags and things piled high in the trunk The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and takin their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus just as one of them reaches my row that used to be our row, on our way off It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head Adolescence is doin her a ton of favors bodywise She stops and looks down at me And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile And she says one word: "destiny" Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus I didn't know you were friends with them I find my dad in the parking lot He drives me back to our house and camp is over So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts This isn't a story about how girls are evil, or how love is bad This is a story about how I learned something I'm not saying this thing is true or not I'm just saying it's what I learned I told you something, and, it was just for you and you told everybody So I learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody Everybody already knows, I told them But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you Is it sad? Sure, but it's a sadness I chose I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit But that's not true The truth is I got on the bus a boy, and I never got off the bus I still haven't The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Childish Gambino Album: Break (All of the Lights) (S) * Song: Break (All of the Lights) Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash * obviously a remake/parody of Kanye West [Intro] Turn on the lights in here, baby Extra bright, I want y'all to see this!
