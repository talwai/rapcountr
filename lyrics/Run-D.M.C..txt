Song: Hard Times Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com Hard times spreading just like the flu Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you P-p-prices go up, don't let your pocket go down When you got short money you're stuck on the ground Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the clock And be on point for the future shock Hard times (repeat 2x) Hard times are coming to your town So stay alert, don't let them get you down They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card Hard times got our pockets all in chains I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain All day I have to work at my peak Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak Hard times Hard times can take you on a natural trip So keep your balance, and don't you slip Hard times is nothing new on me I'm gonna use my strong mentality Like the cream of the crop, like the crop of the cream B-b-beating hard times, that is my theme Hard times in life, hard times in death I'm gonna keep on fighting to my very last breath Hard times (repeat 6x) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Run-D.M.C.

Song: It's Like That Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com [Run]  Unemployment at a record highs  People coming, people going, people born to die  Don't ask me, because I don't know why  But it's like that, and that's the way it is  [D.M.C.]  People in the world tryin to make ends meet  You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet  I said you got to work hard, you want to compete  It's like that, and that's the way it is  Huh!  [Run & D.M.C. alternate lines for the remainder of the song]  Money is the key to end all your woes  Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows  Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?  It's like that, and that's the way it is  Bills rise higher every day  We receive much lower pay  I'd rather stay young, go out and play  It's like that, and that's the way it is  Huh!  Wars going on across the sea  Street soldiers killing the elderly  Whatever happened to unity?  It's like that, and that's the way it is  Disillusion is the word  That's used by me when I'm not heard  I just go through life with my glasses blurred  It's like that, and that's the way it is  Huh!  You can see a lot in this lifespan  Like a bum eating out of a garbage can  You noticed one time he was your man  It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is  You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade  But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid  Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid  It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is  Huh!  One thing I know is that life is short  So listen up homeboy, give this a thought  The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?  It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is  If you really think about it times aren't that bad  The one that flexes with successes will make you glad  Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad  It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is  Huh!  When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts  For a meaning in life is why you search  Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church  It's like that, and that's the way it is  Here's another point in life you should not miss  Do not be a fool who's prejudiced Because we're all written down on the same list  It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is  Huh! You know it's like that, and that's the way it is  Because it's like that, and that's the way it is (Repeat these lines til fade) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Run-D.M.C.

I rock the party with the words I speak And Run says the rhymes that are unique And Jay cuts the records every day of the week And we are the crew that can never be beat So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end The rhymes we say, shall set a trend Because a devestating rap is what we send Every jam we play, we break two needles There's three of us but we're not the Beatles My name is Darryl, you can call him D You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC People always ask, "DMC, what does it mean?" D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean Like we said before, we rock hardcore I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw And now we got the knack, to attract Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot When it comes to rock, give it all we got To be MC's, we got what it takes Let the poppers pop and the breakers break We're cool cool cats, it's like that That's the way it is, so stay the hell back We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's Cause they don't make no songs like these PERIOD!

I must be dreaming Everybody's ?? when I see men dealing for a rhyme or rope, or a dime of coke Sometimes I rhyme when I'm crying broke Many many many records broke laws, broke jaws A few months ago I had to "Pause" During that time, me and my man was chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands A beef broke out, at Soul Kitchen spot It was crazy Baby Pop, someone got shot I seen him drop - then came the cops Sayin, "Nobody run - everybody stop" I wanted to run, cause I was carryin my gun Darryl Mack packin mine, strapped with my nine Everyone on the wall, that's what the cop said Everyone complied, except Bald Dread, he said, "Blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat Yo I'm a superstar for de world dem call 'im Darryl Mack" I turned around and said, "Word up cop!" He said, "D.M.C., take your ass down the block" If it happened to him, it could happen to you cause that's what's happenin on The Avenue when I.. "uhh, uhh uhh, uhh.. uhh.." 	"Na-na-na-na-na! The Ave." [Run] Now on The Ave. (what?) people steal and they dealin away I got the feelin the illin will never ever pay Cause on the street, you're never in the fast lane You go to jail or get a bullet in your brain People laugh and smile at a stick-up A young man in a rut, shakin a big cup People pass his ass and say, "Tough luck" To waste time for a dime is cold fucked up A loud shot in the air - not rare A brother fell to the ground, nobody cares You ask why, the baby cry, a man laugh Nobody give a damn, that's how they livin on The Ave. ... AUUUGH! [D.M.C.] Away from The Ave. they have what's called the backstreets Another world of girls that crawl the backseats Systems that are kickin, sinkin many black beats (This and that goin on ??? street) I remember the time there was a jam in ??? ??, the music, no ?? til after dark That's when the shit starts happening (Brother from The Ave. this and that again) Body move in the back and a quarter in the jar Find the rules by the basketball court in the park And the ? by the bench where the 40 dogs spark The crowd crowds around like they found Noah's Ark The young, hung, and swung on a swing Glidin and slidin and ride the ding-a-ling I didn't see a kid by the see, so he saw (Near the monkey bars, funky cars we adore) I'm throwin fate to the gate ?? ??

Yo, my home boys Run DMC (verse two Run DMC) A young girl seemed to be gaining weight Her parents all thought it was the food she ate Their attitudes were all la-de-da-de But little did they know there's a baby in the body She tried to hide it,but they'll soon know Because sooner or later that baby's got to show Can her daddy just accept it as a fact That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack Then there's another girl,her name is Vicki The girl is fine,but sho'nuff tricky Vicki's fine,,but then she's not very kind She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind You wake up in the morning and you're feelin' blue Because Vicki is gone and your money is too She's more sinister than Peter Lorre And this is just two of 8 million stories 8 million stories (x12) (verse three Kurtis Blow) Fresh kid and the stories complete Born on a dim lit ghetto street Father unknown,mother astray He learned about life the real hard way Wearin' pretty things for all the ladies to see Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry Spent all his time just counting his bank Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha,now fill in the blank Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long Been the subject of a ghetto song Poor kids admire,ladies desire They say water can't put out this fire Because he's a fresh kid,yeah he's alright Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night And you could measure or even treasure The thought that cocaine became his pleasure Puruvian rock never cut with speed And he gets skied untill his nose would bleed And that was just one weakness,must admit That when he took a hit he could never quit Because he's one slick pusher livin' day by day When the crazy thing happened along the way You know he started to base at a hell a pace And now it's a disgrace,he's got the pipe in his face For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones Didn't take care of business,didn't answer the phone He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone Just bittin' on a pipe like a dog on a bone Turnin' blue in the face,by holdin' his breath With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest But then he tried to stop,but it never worked And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk Just to break it all down,you know he's not very slick Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick He lost his car,his house,his friends and his wife And basing cocaine made him lose his wife Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away In a blaze of glory in his own territory 8 million stories sad but all real stories 8 million stories (x12) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Limp Bizkit f/ Run-D.M.C.
