Would he be a candidate or just a black in community? Because black dudes tend to lack unity And them blacker girls ain't on the tube, usually Right now, at 23, I ain't mad at them reds no more But for long time I had gone cold Blindfolded my own insecurity was holding me back to reds, I ain't know how to act They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act A defense mechanism what I thought that I lacked Confidence The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Wale f/ Lady Gaga Album: ATTENTION: DEFICIT Song: Chillin Typed by: lildomo01@hotmail.com "Hey Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" Sample Na Na Na Na...

[Verse: Wale] Sometimes a simple cadence can get in the way of greatness of a nigga statements I feel I know a little bit of everything but I've grown unfamiliar with limitations See I'm just a narrator that's see the world as a nigga who never made it I forever debate a nigga who stand in the way of my standing ovation Nigga I'd be lying to tell you my mind isn't exhausted But to recline is to say God's blessing isn't as awesome as I flaunted See I got more haters and nay sayers than eight Lakers in Boston So I happen to Phil Jacksons along the way with this talking See I give my heart to an unforgiven genre where passion is frowned upon With a muzzle around em all a league full of dry rhymers I proceed to... cannonball Loose cannon starts us off and crucified for the passionate ways... I'm only but a man but man enough to challenge all And I love you all And I pray you just don't think I'm smart and see my vision and know my heart This is 11.1.11... 11.1.11... 11.1.11 is when it all makes sense When my critics break down and make amends with my supporters Who been supporting me since day one can tell you niggas who fronted Wale polish and guess what Wale got it...
