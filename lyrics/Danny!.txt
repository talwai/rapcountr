I want you to call when you get ready Not because my legs feel like spaghetti Every time I take a little walk down memory lane Remember Jerry? Remember Elaine? It's a little too soon to say goodbye I knew I should've told you 'bout the money I was making on the side But I was full of pride and I didn't wanna lose you Let's sit and talk a while, sharing stories like we used to Get used to me askin' to come back in my life You almost left me once but I won't let it happen twice The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danny!

Album: The College Kicked-Out Song: My Way Typed by: bcampb20@student.scad.edu [Verse] Yeah I'm lukewarm now but I was cold once The rap game won't accept me, I ain't got gold fronts I don't cruise on dubs, I don't shoot up clubs I don't push weight homie, I never moved drugs But I did start from the bottom Had a hard head, soft bottom And now the Billboard charts got him Ranked at number one, and thanks to everyone Who appreciates what I'm doin' here The beats that I make are a keepsake, like a souvenir But I wasn't always doin' music I was stupid and foolish Livin' life recklessly Like the time when the magistrate arrested me I was writin' like, check after check every week Couldn't help it but the money interested me But I wised up quick, best believe that Now I only cop a sweater if I need that, yeah I came a long way from pickin' up chicken at Dodge's To bein' on stage, shimmyin' next to Roger Those were the good days, but I'm forgettin' Some of them didn't want me in, they said that I was different So I fell back, and I prayed about it Couple days later, heard them boys had came around and Now I'm onstage with a cane, shoutin' my name Yeah, y'all know the rest Yeah, and there are many other instances to speak about But I ain't mention 'em on purpose, had to leave 'em out 'Cause if I told you everything that I've been through You'd probably wanna jump up out the window And if I told you 'bout the things that I've seen You might scream 'til your eyes pop out like high beams Have your ass drinkin' Visine, yeah I did it my way Like Baskin-Robbins ice cream, Irene take it away!

Album: The College Kicked-Out Song: No Guarantees Typed by: nunley04@hotmail.com [Verse 1] I can flow with the best of 'em Do shows with the rest of 'em Mos Def, Kweli, Kanye West and 'em But when it comes to doin' a gig Down where I live, man the shit is ri-dic-u-lous I did a show at the Colonial Center But the crowd was real cold like the snow in the winter Damn! It must've been the lyrics I spit 'Cause 'round here, they don't wanna hear no spiritual shit Ain't nothin' worse than lookin' up at a (dead-eyed crowd) And if I jumped into the audience, I bet I'd drown 'Cause I'm about one song, maybe two or three Maybe four songs away from the crowd booing me Feel like a failure when the crowd gets shady Man this shit'll drive you (crazy) I'm a product of the eighties So I sit in my Mercedes, after a show Then I cry like a baby but don't let nobody know "I can turn it on But I'm holdin' back the guarantee" I get excited every time that I recite it I can put it down but I can't make you like it "I can turn it on But I'm holdin' back the guarantee" (Jay-Z: "All I need is the love of my crew The whole industry can hate me, I'll thug my way through") [Verse 2] It ain't the same when I perform in a different state Up in Wisconsin they be feedin' me fish and steak Don't get me wrong now, I love the Metro And the Metro got love for me But it's hard for me, to bring a new kind of sound When all they wanna hear from me is "Second Time Around" Damn! There's more to Columbia than thugs And drugs, and studs and dubs and wylin' in the club, what I got booed at a show downtown But at the afterparty all I ever got was pounds And daps; this one cat said "I like your raps But could you talk about guns? That'd be kinda phat" Dude I'll be right back...I took a stroll outside And gave my head another blow to the bike rack Now I ain't gotta rap about havin' guns, but instead I can tell everybody I be bustin' heads, take 'em to the house [Verse 3] All I ever do is rock a show and hope for the best I told a Seinfeld joke and it went over their head And I ain't even tryin' to be the Dennis Miller of rap I'm tryin' to get the crowd jumpin' 'til the ceiling collapse 'Cause on the mic +I Try+ hard like Macy Gray And when the DJ puts on "Stay Away" The whole crowd wyles out, and starts riots But when he puts on "Talk To You" the whole room get quiet Now I could get frustrated and forget the game But that shit would be (crazy), yo I'd miss the fame Catchin' flights to Korea, takin' trips to Spain It'd take a whole lot of money to convince my brain So until then, I'ma do what I does It ain't the fame or the money, it's the music I love ...and if I ever get desperate I'll fuck around and put Lil' Jon on a record, say I won't do it [Chorus] - 2X The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danny!

I'll give you the code all right And that number is (7-8-5, 4-7 I'm not givin' out the rest) Lemme stop before I incriminate myself any further Charlamagne already does a good job of that [Verse 2] You people can't get past my past I'm gassed, at last they asked Me to be the scapegoat, so take note I'ma say this one time and one time only I'ma keep pleadin' my case until the sun shine on me Regardless of what happened at Claflin I'm glad that I'm rappin' At least I'm doing something with my life Unlike, you other cats still sittin' through assembly at school I'm fixin' to be sittin' in a Bentley, it's cool Some cats never heard of me So they run and get their little rumors from Burger King Last week my label got a phone call from Murder Inc. But y'all don't care about that You'd rather try to hold this cat back Get on radio and mention my past But I'm laughin' 'cause pretty soon y'all be kissin' my... D. Swain, the source of Charlamagne's rage Now we on the same page, maybe YOU should change grades Holla at ya boy [Danny! talking] Y'all got me embarrassed man I had to make like, three beats in two hours Y'know, I'm spittin' over unfinished material right now But uh, don't worry I saved the heat for last Still wanna talk to y'all, so um Just gimme a minute of your time real quick I got somethin' to say, get off my chest [Verse 3] Soon as somebody gets a trick, a gimmick You pricks get in it Quicker than Christmas dinner with grits and spinach Invested hard work and made a decent album Now you people wanna treat me like police did Malcolm? I'll keep the peace, but how come Every time I try to turn down the hate, y'all increase the volume? Dag! Y'all released the beast outta him Now he's on a rampage, it's too late to reach out to him Hearsay's for queers, expelled Danny off a hunch? I guess they had their panties in a bunch I'm just Payton a picture...oops! Did I say "Payton"? I meant to say "painting" a picture So keep takin' your cheap shots, it don't phase me at all I dream big but was born small Callin' me a cornball? I was the best on the yard Keep poppin' junk, you'll be wakin' up with F's on your card, holla [Danny! talking] And it's final exam season so I would watch out if I were you The Boogie Man is back, yeah I do it for the underdogs, man Can't hate me for this one, I had to Man, y'all got me started, for real You can't expel somebody off of hearsay and no evidence man But the irony of it is, I still want my brick in Legacy Plaza So um, after I blow up I'ma give a million dollars to Claflin, word up Can't hate me for that D.

Song: Intro Typed by: hhs1978kells@yahoo.com [Verse] You mad at the last album, I apologize for it Yo, I can't call it, man muh'fuckin' Wyclef spoiled it Get a sense of humor, muthafuckas Can't you see I'm doin' this for my amusement muthafucka? Hatin' on Puff won't make ya tough So take this duct tape away and tape it shut You hate my guts, really I don't give eight fucks Too late to change it up, muh'fucka get your weight up Fake friends smilin' in my face Shake hands while I'm in the place Then they put the knife to my back Get on the radio and talkin' they don't like how I rap Well I don't like how you look You just an ugly-ass lame But I'm 'bout to change the game And resurrect the Daisy Age at the same time I'm patient with mine Hey yo, this intro is a hard banger The Dark Ranger, the Report Card Changer is back I'm laughin' at you niggas right now Artist: Danny! Album: F.O.O.D. Song: F.O.O.D. Typed by: pnai_smilez@yahoo.com [Verse 1] Sometimes I get to wonderin', brainstormin' and thunder And lightning and rain, inside of the mind of D. Swain Inside of the mind of a changed man A little deranged at times, but otherwise a sane man Dang man, I've been on the path to success For so long, I feel like I'm the last to be next But hold on, I see a signpost ahead That says 'turn around', I can't leave my hopes for dead I'm too throwed in the game to just throw it away If I quit now, my dreams'll go tip-toeing away I've gotta find my destination sooner or later A true innovator is what I wanna be known as But to get to the top, it's gonna take my own ass To blow past these low-class jealous mome raths, yeah And say everything that I have to say I'm trying to find my destination, better grab ya plates This is the F.O.O.D. [Chorus: *scratches by Danny*] "It's the...it's the food, baby" - Common "Get yours...get yours..." - Nas "You know the...you know the...you know the deal...deal" - Mos Def "...but I scrape the plate...the plate...the plate" - Jay-Z "It's the...it's the food, baby" - Common "Get yours...get yours..." - Nas "You know the...you know the...you know the deal...deal" - Mos Def "Get yours...get yours..." - Nas [Verse 2] Regrets cloudin' my future, hit rewind Like layin' in a bed of cow manure, I got shit on my mind Grittin' and grindin' for my moment in the sun But my hopes are stunted; how am I supposed to get it done? Whoever said that strugglin' was easy Probably never had the luxury of hustlin' or being chased I swear to God they tryin' to change my fate An appetite for success so I scrape the plate I grab a bite, so I guess I gotta wait for the date That I get to where I need to be Compare the recent me, to the me of times past I could've easily sold my soul to the wine glass And even though I might crash, I'm still drivin' down this bright path Thoughts leaking from my pen, hope I write fast enough To be an outcast is tough I'm flyin' solo with a bag full of stuff Nigga that's what's up [Verse 3] Two roads diverged in a wood, I took the one less travelled I'm patient so that's one less hassle If I dream it, I can live it I've seen the light with vivid imagery I need to write with fits of energy But it's hard tryin' to get where I'm goin' Without a hint or an omen It's too late to turn around Perseverance, gotta learn it now But I'm stubborn how Am I supposed to survive this rollercoaster hurtlin' to the ground? I've heard the sound of naysayers Yes-men, and all of the rest tend to follow 'em I could get hurt by all the jokes and stares Smoke and mirrors, I'm chokin' but I'm almost there Almost clear, the reason why I've suffered for years I'm glad I started down this road to my own career I'm never full from all the F.O.O.D. I ate I'm on the road to be a true rhyme great This is the muthafuckin' F.O.O.D. Artist: Danny! Album: F.O.O.D.

Yo, maybe I should use smaller words instead I don't know if you noticed or not But so far, this album hasn't even gone over the top You don't even know if I'm focused or not While you debate, I'ma pick which Ford Focus to cop Fuck a Benz, and I don't want a Beemer Rather have a shack, and a styrofoam water heater, uh "But didn't Danny say he drove a white Rov'?" I was bullshittin', but thanks for paying attention though You couldn't stop me with divine intervention, no But you can catch me at the Rhymers' Convention, yo I'll be the guest speaker I'd be the best teacher I'd spit some lyrical bullets and watch your chest leak a Gallon of blood, drop face-down in the mud You just mad they called that new Mase album a dud Welcome ME back [Chorus: Danny! talking] I see y'all muh'fuckas right now man Y'all ain't even expect me to come back You'll be sittin' there with a lil' smile on your face Like, "awww, he gon' fail, he gon' fail" But naw, fuck that shit Y'all muh'fuckas make me laugh, dog I'm actually...man, y'all entertain me I'm here to entertain y'all Y'all makin'me laugh, what the fuck C'mon now [Verse 2] My redemption song Is sweeter than a senior citizen with dentures on I never really meant to leave you, it's been so long You know I write eighty miles an hour, pen so strong, uh My first LP? Critics didn't like it But it's all good, just as long as pregnant women buy THIS I don't care if niggas hate on my shit because The negativity just gives me a buzz And I appreciate the radio spins (Y'all muh'fuckas got me on the radio real good, that shit was mad funny yo) Your show is trash, watch who get the last laugh Half-ass wack nigga, lookin' like you crashed Your face into a brick wall, nigga get some balls And get off of my nuts You lost yo' mind, cuz?

Can't believe I fuckin' wasted four bars on this nigga, peep How I transition back, but damn this and that 'Cause this is where it's at I used to wear a hat but my head kinda swolled up Dropped "The College Kicked-Out", everybody goin' nuts Didn't think I had it in me I drink a splash of Remy These half-rappers only half-offend me, I ain't fuckin' with 'em The whole world can kiss my ass 'til their lips stick to my pants Controversy like Lindsay Lohan gettin' breast implants I'm the next Rembrandt of rap Give me a chance, in fact I'll have you shakin' like a panic attack Dammit I'm back and I ain't goin' nowhere Everybody so scared 'cause I'm so prepared It's D.

Album: F.O.O.D. Song: It Changes Typed by: dredmanj@yahoo.com [Verse 1] Dear Teresa I hope you get this letter You know I have to send it to an alternate address Because your man'll come across it And probably bug the fuck out He'll read about the stuff we used to do when you had snuck out But listen, I'm through with foolish talk and reminiscin' As much as I would like to take it back when we was just friends I just can't, I care about you way too much And for your patience I can't thank you enough, now think about it Ever since I drove you away My sunny days have been so cold and so gray And all the color is gone We really had a love that was strong I didn't mind you probably rode the same school bus my mother was on Age is just another number How I got myself into this situation Makes a brother wonder I let you down and now I'm drowning in my self-pity I hope these words'll help forgive me Please don't leave Just when you think that you know where you stand You've got the world in your hands Just when you're sure of a dream that you've planned That's when the scenery changes It changes [Verse 2] How could I ever doubt you? You told me, you WARNED me to take things at face value Conclusions were jumped to I still remember seeing red, cryin' cause you just wouldn't come through I've come to my senses But I sense it's too late You're packing up your suitcase And you're headin' out I swear, I just...oh shit Hol' up my pen's out of ink.. I'm tired of goodbyes I need more hellos It's funny how a black boy grows And his maturity enhances I think that we deserve a second chance With our personal romance 'Cause I don't know where I stand You said not to put your trust in man But you put your trust in me Baby please don't up and leave Forget my phone, let it ring More than my friend, you're my everything (everything) [Verse 3] If I could take it back That letter off your windshield, to the time we made a pact And said no matter what would happen Wherever things would take us We wouldn't let (we couldn't let) misunderstanding break us Or miscommunication, I miss the communication I miss seeing you smile and yes, I miss your jubilation I'm in for a rude awakening, if I ever expect Things to get better; forgive me but never forget Next time I'll think twice, before doin' something rash And risk losing everything that I had I thought I learned my lesson after ??? left me Any questions that you have Take a second and ask My world changed dramatically In a matter of months It all happened at once I pray you don't stay mad at me I'll always love you, for better or worse I'm forever yours, it hurts To not have you near me Sincerely Artist: Danny! f/ Ms. Lisha Album: F.O.O.D.

We can go shoppin' for shoes The Nike Airs with the matchin' laces We can go to Marks & Morgan, get some matchin' bracelets Don't get it twisted, I ain't tryin' to spit game But I'll be honest with you, half these niggas is lame They're only after one thing, and we both know what it is So I hope you underdig where I'm comin' from I'm trying to make you my number one, my main squeeze Baby tell me what you want from me, I aim to please It's plain to see, I hope that you believe me boo I only wanna be with you, now bring the chorus in [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 2] Girl...why you over there lookin' at me Like I'm tryin' to be your sugar daddy? I'm not a gigolo, I don't keep the hookers happy But I'll bet that if we hang out for a while I can make you smile We can go to Kim's Diner, play pool with some friends But I'ma beat you; I'm just lettin' you know And there's way too many reasons why I'm sweatin' you for And if I give you a hug, I ain't lettin' you go Later on we can take a little walk in the park It's not often my heart makes me fall in love so fast I've been through a lot baby, I've been hurt in the past But we can make this work perfect if our purpose is to last At last, I finally found the girl I wanna be with Someone I can hold and share my secrets with Don't keep the fence to your heart up for too long C'mon baby and let's groove to the song I only wanna be with you [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 3] So what's the deal, you don't have to be confused at all If you wanna roll, all you have to do is call And I'll be there to pick you up if you fall Order a root beer float and get two straws You can always call on me if you wanna talk I'll be right there, I won't even give it a second thought You know you're fine, I tell you all the time You're what the other fellas call a dime, but I call you a queen And I wanna fulfill all of your dreams If you're diggin' what I'm sayin' just follow me And if not then my apologies For wastin' your time, baby You makin' my mind crazy 'Cause all I do is think about you Hoping that you feel me too but then I could be wrong Hey yo, this ain't no mushy song but you gotta put me on I need ya, I need ya, I need ya I only wanna be with you [Chorus] - 4X Artist: Danny! Album: F.O.O.D. Song: So All Alone Typed by: jaii_ford@yahoo.com Yo, yo I had the weirdest dream last night kid Word up [Verse] I didn't hear any sounds Hopped out of my bed, looked for my friend But he's nowhere to be found I never ever had this feeling before Seems like a longer distance from the ceiling to the floor When I look up I grabbed my Kappa chain for good luck And walked out of the house, but... Damn, where'd everybody go? It felt like I was dead but I don't know The only sound I heard was the voice in my head Tellin' me to play it cool, but I made another choice instead Started yellin' at the top of my lungs, so all the noise could spread In hopes that anybody would hear me But clearly, the whole entire world must be sleepin' Or keepin' quiet, 'cause everything's completely in silence No traffic, no commotion, no racket Just a sad nigga tryin' to figure out what happened It's like the whole world flew away in a spaceship And I just overslept and made it late to the trip So quiet that you could hear a friggin' faucet drip I felt like hidin' in a closet with balled fists, a small fit I wouldn't work; I'm nervous, I'm all alone Like I'm in an episode of "The Twilight Zone" Surrealism had me feelin' imprisoned Had me tryin' to figure out why everybody was missin' Started walkin' down the street but it felt strange So I took a look around and certain things had changed On one side of the lane were all the nice-lookin' houses On the other side, ugly ones with mice, crooked couches And a dumpster on the curb, I felt sorta disturbed Curious too, I didn't have a theory or clue So I walked up inside of the ugly house What I saw then damn near shut my mouth 'Cause the interior was gorgeous And it's hard to walk 'cause the floor is slick Made of marble? Who could afford this? The filthy couches on the curb must've had me fooled Because the inside was kinda cool I'm a schoolboy so I can't forget my manners Tried to find the owner If he finds me first he'll prob'ly go bananas I shouted out but nobody's home Took me a second to realize I'm still alone I walk out, but I feel like I'm exhausted, beat So I headed to the other house across the street The attractive house with the seven cars in the driveway But I should've stayed outside, my mistake I stepped inside and I could've died The whole place looked, smelled and felt like a pig sty The furniture was tattered, and if I had an Explanation I still would be confused 'cause it wouldn't matter I couldn't fathom it, I had to admit The house was nice on the outside, but the inside was shit It smelled worse than sweaty armpits Tables and chairs had three legs, made it hard to sit I disregarded it, until I turned around And I found a little notice that was on the ground This house is condemned, I should've known But the seven cars had me thrown for a loop Still all alone, I had to recoup For lost time, all of my fears have been confirmed Weird thoughts crossin' my mind Like nobody else is in the world but me If that's the way it's supposed to be Then so be it I awoke from sleep in a cold sweat Holdin' a wet notebook and an old cassette Tape full of beats and a folder full of studio receipts Somebody had my CD on repeat I looked up and it was my friend With a grin, said he spent The whole night playin' my CD again and again, yeah Told me that nobody else in the game was the same as me Shit, that explains everything...! Artist: Danny! Album: F.O.O.D. Song: Prove Myself Typed by: nick.gant@gulfstream.com [Verse 1] Picture me tryin' to prove myself Like I'm convinced a shot of vodka would improve my health Or move my wealth to seven-hundred-and-four figures Got more niggas tryin' to hate on my flow than Rah Digga Bigger balls than last year, I'm cocky as ever And more fly than a box of Czechoslovakian sweaters When I hop in the Jetta I put my CD on blast If you don't like me nigga fuck you, kiss my ass I ain't got nothin' to prove, so you can beat it Niggas heated when I breathe on the mic, I'm so conceited I give a shit if you don't like what I'm rappin' Go back to your rims, your grills, your pills, your ice and your trappin' Y'all ignorant niggas, y'all need help Don't you know my track record? Man it speaks for itself I kept the best beats for myself My instrumentals out of reach on the shelf You can't touch me [Chorus] - 2X I don't need to prove myself I don't need to prove myself [Verse 2] How many times must I tell ya? Catering to everyone turns you to a failure That's why I don't get mad when they say that I'm wack Or hate on my tracks, talkin' all that shit in my ear, yeah Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come here The first cat to drop an album and get rich in one year Got more status in my pinky than Patricia Romer' In her whole career Charismatic with a capital K The Smooth Kriminal is back to put the wackness to shame It didn't have to happen this way But I got sick of niggas rappin' the same You need practice mayne I'm in a class of my own The rap game's George Thorogood, I'm +Bad To The Bone+ I'm glad to be home, quit talkin' all that trash on the phone Don't call me with that bullshit, you can rap to the tone Holla [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 3] I give a fuck who you battled against Underground/mainstream, yo I straddle the fence When I step up to the mic, all the kids say "wow" I'll bet you're probably gonna want me on your mixtape now It's great how a dude tries to do his own thing Tries to spread his own wings then a diss breaks out First album that I dropped was a classic Took it to the radio and then they tried to trash it Callin' me a lame but really I'm the last sick Nigga with a habit of kickin' niggas asses quick And I don't really give a fuck about who's tough You'd figure that the lyrics that I'm spittin' would be proof enough But no; if I ain't talkin' 'bout 'caine-sniffin' Wood grain-grippin', lane-switchin', bangin' the fifth Then I ain't really sayin' shit or D. Swain is a bitch But I ain't changin' what I spit until D. Swain is richer than you The fuck I gotta listen to you for? You niggas swear you're too hardcore, I'm havin' fun with this shit [Chorus] - 2X Artist: Danny! Album: F.O.O.D.

Song: My Whole World Typed by: inspiration4truth@hotmail.com [Verse 1] I see skies of blue and clouds of white Fuck that, I see hungry children cryin' every night Single mothers on welfare, these kids can't eat The whereabouts of their daddy is a mystery Poverty, probably is keepin' blacks in debt And that's why every first of the month we cash our checks And ask to get, a lottery ticket and some Newports So surreal, kinda like a movie of sorts I see so many things in my world goin' on So this song was conceived with my heart on my sleeve Little boys droppin' out of school, it's hard to believe And little girls being raped, now it's hard to conceive A child, I'm seein' niggas that'll stab you in the back For a pack of cigarettes, and a jacket that matches His bandana, gangbangers, 'caine slangers, chain swingers Check out the picture that D. Swain paints for us Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls Let me welcome you to (my whole world, my whole world) No diamonds and pearls, just stones And broken homes (my whole world, my whole world) I'm only paintin' a picture I care about it this much (my whole world, my whole world) Follow me and we can see some things C'mon and walk with D. Swain (my whole world, my whole world) [Verse 2] I see trees of green, red roses too I see a preacher doin' things he ain't supposed to do Collection plates, he's puttin' in his back pocket But karma's a bitch, so best believe he's gettin' robbed quick Fake gangstas and wanna-be thugs Shootin' up the club, hot over a bottle of bub I see a bunch of drunken junkies, potholes and drugs A lot of homeless families with no one to love, but um The worst thing is that it hurts to see An uneducated black man in his thirties But y'all don't hear me or your eyes are wide shut Dudes goin' to job interviews high as fuck What the fuck? I see politicians makin' promises To fuck us up quicker than the '80s Reaganomics did I see bums on the stoop lookin' stupid They had a shot at life and didn't use it [Verse 3] Twelve-year-olds with cell phones Callin' their man up so he can hit it when nobody else is home I see kids havin' kids, man it is what it is Homie this is how we live Prostitutes, they're on the street corner peddlin' sex Disabled vets, waitin' on their settlement checks, yep! 20 percent of money is spent on women The other 80 is wasted on vodka Stop the madness kid, ain't no adjectives That can describe how I feel when I look back at this shit Pops drunk, now he's smackin' the kids The next day, can't remember what he did I see people settin' up their own kinfolk Babies gettin' sick from their mama's secondhand smoke I see a man hittin' a lady but he ain't a pimp though I'm just sittin' by my window And this is what I see Artist: Danny!

Song: Mind's Made Up Typed by: allmytnaledge@aol.com [Chorus] - 2X I've made up my mind for a lifetime I've made up my mind for a lifetime [Verse 1] Bring in the verse and let's go I think I've gotta be the most indecisive person I know That incident I can't forget about in Paris, France I spent seven hours pickin' out a pair of pants I'm just a rapper, a bastard child But sometimes, I think my brain is on backwards After a while, I'll finally come to a decision or two It's kinda funny what a 90/20 vision'll do Like this one time, I must've set the time One hour too late, woke up at a quarter to 8 I had to be at work in fifteen But it takes me forty-five minutes just to get clean After showerin' another half-an-hour when I iron a shirt, you've gotta try it, it works I'm tryin' to find an excuse to not go to work, but instead I swallowed my pride and got out of bed Funky as hell [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 2] Now I'm at my baby mom's house If this chick gets to actin' crazy, I'm out Kinda mad another nigga treats her better than I did But I'm here to see my kid Me and Zoe playin' patty-cake I put her to sleep, and now I'm wantin' something to eat So I'm in the kitchen lookin' for a plate I look up and my baby mama's standin' in the doorway She said, "Danny boy, we can do it your way Give it to me daddy, I don't even need the foreplay" Now I COULD smash potatoes and leave But she'd be calling me for weeks And I wouldn't be able to breathe All I want is mashed potatoes and greens Apple juice, where the cups at? Shorty grabbed my nutsack, panties fell down to the floor Ahhh, fuck it; just listen out for the door Man, pass me a towel [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 3] D. Swain, and I'm back as The phat trackmaker, for paper I would razor-blade your black ass But don't think for a second that I'm clueless Just because I'm inconclusive, get a clue bitch But before I let you go, true story: I was rockin' at this show and everyone was rootin' for me But this one guy was booin' at the top of his lungs Being rude and obnoxious, son So I finish my set, walk off the stage and I get The same lame nigga in my face, making a threat He said go back to the Gap, because my flow was wack And my beats are trash, what kind of critique is that? A bad decision would've meant I had to listen to him But if I did then I'd be missin' music It's been a year to the day that I took that chance I made up my mind to rap and I ain't look back since Yo that's real talk man [Chorus] - 4X Artist: Danny!

'Cause I am...I'ma teach you the rules of the game man Don't rap about shit that you ain't got We see right through you dog...lyin' ass [Verse 3] I'm teachin' rappers how to keep in practice But they're looking at me funny like I'm speaking backward Sleep in class or read a mag with tig ol' bitties And I'll bet your ass'll fail, and get a 50 On this test that I'm passin' out You better throw all your chances of passin' out When you see your test scores you'll be passin' out And your skills'll still stink, if you pass an outhouse You probably couldn't even tell the difference Your whole flow's like a bowl of Kibbles and Bits and shit I hope you fuckers paid a little attention It's a shame that the dean got rid of detention 'Cause I'd let you sit there 'Til you learn how to get to where you need to be, lyrically Instead of focusing on fame and bucks It's D.

Album: F.O.O.D. Song: What She Said Typed by: cecemcclendon@gmail.com [Chorus] - 2X All, all, all the time All, all, all the time [Verse 1] I met her at The Spin She said her favorite book was "Catcher In The Rye" It grabbed me by surprise Had to take a second look, thought I saw some magic in her eyes Disco lights were playin' tricks all night She said, "If it's all right I'd like to buy you a bottle Of Heineken are you Old enough to even be drinkin'?" I laughed to myself, 'cause I can read what she's thinkin' But she shocked me when she said, "you don't need to be winkin' At these other chicks," she said that she could work the dick Said she liked it from the back, and she loves to lick Now I usually get a kick from a broad talkin' dirty But something just didn't click, plus my plane leaves early But dammit she lookin' thick, she's still being flirty She said that I could meet her at the hotel at 3:30 Don't wanna risk it, can't stand to be wrong But she said that she'd be waiting with no panties on Danny's gone! [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 2] She said her hotel was down the street I left the club an hour later, she was sound asleep She was startled by the sound of my feet, I knocked softly So the manager would not toss me Out on the curb, I'm twenty minutes late, gonna cost me She offered me a bagel and a cup of coffee I said "naw", she's shoving her tongue down my throat She said she really wanted to rock my boat She said I'm not supposed to do a thing, just relax She was lickin' my neck, yo she was kissin' my back Then she said, "Let's get down to the nitty-gritty" I pulled my pants down, whipped out the itty-bitty She said, "Damn Danny, either you're cold Or you have the penis size of a five-year-old" She said she likes to have it all the time But she never met a dude with a dick that was smaller than mine That's fucked up [Chorus] - 2X Artist: Danny!

I'm 'bout to say goodbye to the game I'm tired of playin' (Goodbye!) Goodbye to the fame and money Yo ain't a damn thing funny (Goodbye!) Goodbye to the hatin' for real Too many niggas talk greasy, fa' sheezy (Goodbye!) (Jay-Z: "Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me!") [Verse 1] I've been in the rap game for a minute Stackin' change, but the fact remains: this is a business Now I've gotta call it quits, all of this Hatin', it isn't called for; pride tried to swallow it I even tried at Apollo, it Was one fine-ass model, said she's feelin' all my shit But I had a hard time believing it She didn't know my songs by heart, hard time repeating it I swear, no one else appreciates me I'm from the home of white tees, and geechies maybe I should call it a day, and put the mic away I'd like to say I'm playin', but I can't say "sike" And stayin' ain't an option, but patience might stop him From making the mistake of a lifetime, I write rhymes And make beats, but if it don't move your feet I might as well just take a seat Peace out [Verse 2] Fuck rap, you can have it back I feel like a FOX special, "When Doormats Attack" 'Cause I don't feel welcome It's gonna take more than an autograph signing in the store to help him Change his mind, 'cause I'm the same guy that brought you My other hits, like "Stay Away" and "Talk To You" I'm catchin' Flack but my name ain't Roberta These other rappers get away with murder 'Cause every other joint that they pumpin' on the radio Is soundin' like the same ol' lame ol' shit they played way before Meanwhile, I'm out bustin' my ass Can I get an applause? Is it too much to ask? Dag, I think I might as well hang it up Either that or take my style and just change it up D. Swain is just another jaded MC Man I tried to be as patient as can be But I gotta leave [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 3] He said this, and she said that And he claimed that D. Swain couldn't rap I'm better off in the game cookin' crack Took this slack for a minute, sick of people lookin' at Me like I lost my mind I couldn't sell a copy of my CD even if it cost a dime Even the radio won't play my hits I rap about positivity, they hate my shit I gave my album to a friend at the camera shop Man he said that he was feelin' it, he said it was hot But a couple days later, as luck would have it I overheard another nigga say that HE said it sucked ass, shit I tried to bring something new to the table At the rate I'm going I'll be dropped from my label So I'm done, yo I quit, I'm retirin' Applyin' at McDonald's, yo I hope they're still hirin' 'Cause I'm gone Artist: Danny! Album: F.O.O.D. Song: We Gon' Make It Typed by: inspiration4truth@hotmail.com [Verse] All I ever really wanted was my name in the bright lights Tryin' to get my fanbase expandin' from Asians to white dykes I still need a fuckin' publicist It's D. Swain, and I'm giving you my butt to kiss Let me take it way back when I didn't have scratch Listenin' to music, sayin' "I can do this too!" It's cool, just do your thing Don't ever let these haters try to ruin your dreams I knew things would start slow Dealin' with a DJ with mood swings Cheap articles were made, I played my part I stayed on the charts Gotta keep my mind and my tongue razor-sharp Back then, when I did venues for chump change Why they wanna keep the top billing from Swain? Dropped the first name, added a dot And kept the last name -- "is that Swain?" -- daggit, he's hot I went away to school, then I got kicked out Shit happens, but I gotta stick to rappin' I'm still doing shows but they won't quit laughin' When I tell 'em what went down at Claflin, so that's it I get down on my knees and pray For a chance to say everything I need to say Matter fact, I said eight prayers "The College Kicked-Out" dropped five months and eleven days later All of a sudden, a star is born And to think, it all started in a dorm room More boom than a lil' bit I'm a little nitwit that made good A little quick wit will get you real far If you know how to use it Got my whole school doing music, it's true bitch And I'm still tryin' to make it in the game Tryin' to soak up all the fame But I hope it don't choke up all of Swain Yo I'm trying to get these folks to call my name I let 'em clown me so the weak could win Now I'm headed to the top with a sheepish grin Only one hit away like Bleek would've been If he would've been in my shoes, who would've thought?

I'ma shock them all Almost, dropped the ball when my plan backfired I was, supposed to blow so I could stack some loot Go the mainstream route, then get back to my roots Buy a house for my mama and an Acura too But I happened to lose sight of why I started rappin' and Who's the real Danny Too surreal, can he Boost his skill and Reproduce the thrill, and be a Shoe-in at the Grammys?

Damn Man...I can't do it Damn, is Dan foolish Cancelled all plans, that's when temptation Began to be a nuisance Excuses is useless I tried to tell her that I can't make it She said "You can't just make some muthafuckin' plans and break it Besides I wanna do a strip for you and dance naked Damn Danny, I'm throwin' coochie in your hands, take it!" Take it? Take it as a sign from God S'posed to be a Christian but I ain't doin' my job Just then I heard a nice voice Tellin' me to make the right choice Stop livin' life like a slob Was it God or a commercial on the radio?

It depends who you ask that Type of nigga to make a beat from violins and a hatrack Humility, it stems from my cabbage patch Rooted in my friends and my habitat, matter of fact I chop a break fast for breakfast and Beat a nigga to the punch for lunch Dig in the bargain bin for dinner The skinny nigga done made good The media insists that I stay hood But I never was to begin with My penmanship is intricate But Jay already said that it don't get you shit So I would write it if y'all would get it All y'all would-be critics must've mistook me for an idiot I seem soft-spoken But I need not for you to open your mouth And hit me with obscene blog-postin' "What's so special about him?

[Verse 1] Yes, you in the three-piece? "I purchased your first three albums But how do I find your beat CDs?" Beats me; of course you COULD start down Limewire Avenue Turn east on Kazaa Street and beep the horn at the main center And tell 'em D. Swain sent ya "Is it true you went to the Grammmys Off of the strength of 'Charm'?" Yes, I just extended my arm I looked and saw my name on the ballot But not enough votes were gained or tallied Sad story, should've been nominated For the "Overlooked MC" category "Did you really get expelled for making 11 G's Changing student's grades from F's to B's?" Umm, next question please "Hey yo Dan I'm your biggest fan but listen man I'm tryin' to be like you! What's your secret to success?" Jesus, sleep and sex Next? Yes, you in the orange blazer "I think you shouldn't joke on your views of our Lord and Savior" Who's jokin' homie?

I'm gonna keep it real: I doubt it made a major difference Ain't like I'm what the game's been missin' Booth-attacker, wack producer/rapper, slash attempted hacker Nah, I wouldn't have sold; my record would've went fools' gold "Well what about the Def Jux deal now?" I hope that it goes well so please wish me the best of luck for real now Scared to put my future into somebody else's hands with somebody else's plans Damn, somebody help this man "Do you wanna get signed or don't you?" Only if the money's right My money's tight, I beg for table scraps on every Sunday night But I ain't Marmaduke or Scooby-Doo, I paid a lot of Scooby dues So Scooby Dooby Don't you try to screw me, dude [Verse 3] "Why come yo' name never gets mentioned?" The game is payin' attention but dang  I think I'm goin' insane listenin To the pub these others rappers get My album made the Grammy shortlist, but I guess nobody gave a shit "Well what'cha gonna do about it?" Either take another breather Or just take consumers hostage, brandishin' my mother's heater Lead 'em into my basement, my cassette tape taped to their hands And stand on a box and scream at 'em ("take this!") "How come you and so-and-so ain't never collaborate?" I'd love to elaborate, but maybe next Saturday, I don't Hate 'em, I just sour-grapes 'em; takes a man to keep it movin' Keep pursuin' my dreams, elitists keep on snoozin' "You think you'll ever get the props you feel you deserve?" Before that, I'll probably fuck around and join the Reserves Or enlist in the French Legion, sit on the bench with heathens Heavin' smoke from a peace pipe before niggas say "D's tight" Yes, you in the back?

Swain for personal gain Now every time I'd try to push her away, she'd pull the relationship card "Good gracious I hardly know you, don't you have a man you're devoted to?" Pretended to like me to get inside the inner circle I made Whatever it takes to make it I guess, I seen this shit comin' a mile away So I cut her off and I watched her go flutter off, I had my own mind and she hated that But she was too busy to care, her ego was gettin' inflated, back- To-back shows, around the town, she started creatin' a name for herself Kept dissin' her friends, and that's when the ceiling fell in [Bridge # 1] Never forget where you came, never forsake all your friends if fame Should stray in your lane, never use someone to get in the game Oh I know you want success, and yes, there is a cost But lost relationships and actin' fake'll make you sick N-now, the lesson she never learned is your bridges should never burn And the people you see on the way to the top are the same that you'll see at the end of your term Now I know it's been a minute since we've talked on the phone, uh But I'll bet she's probably sittin' at home, and she's probably singin' [Chorus 2X: Maria]  Shouldn't have cost me that much to be happy To be free (to be free) To be me (to be me) [Verse 2] Livin' amuck, not givin' a fuck 'Bout anyone else, except herself Expected herself to be much further along than she was But she was complacent, with the attention, that she was gettin', she never got it before Her friends had been givin' attention, support, of course, unfortunately not anymore She pushed 'em away, the more she became, a local celebrity But she didn't know it was all that she'd ever be, it takes a lot more to get in the door The lime of the light had blinded her sight, so she couldn't see that the people She treated like dirt had gone on to do much bigger, much better things Now several years passed, look at my ass Finally got my name to pop I'm famous, doc; the premise of "Charm" has finally come to life But never got caught up in hype, hopped on a flight to visit the city I earned my stripes Stepped into a lounge I frequented when I was young, and honey was still on the mic She stayed in the city to sing, never achieving her dream Of using her music as means to make her larger than life, 'cause karma came back at her twice She was a former associate of mine, we both had similar dreams But nobody cares, walked out of the club before she realized I was there, yeah [Bridge # 2] She never felt more alive than when she was on the stage But she never realized the reason her friends had all gone away I know that she was selfish, she couldn't help it If only she took control of her fate before it became too late Maybe then she'd have been concerned with not letting her bridges burn 'Cause the people she saw on the way to the top were still at the bottom awaiting their turn, damn It's been a minute since we talked on the phone But now I know she's probably sittin' at home, every night just singin' [Chorus 2X] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danny!

[Verse 2] How do I move on? And still get my groove on? Who's gonna captivate my soul with a new song? Who's gonna saturate my life with a new long- Term relationship and how much longer can I wait for it? When I know the only woman that I loved was you Am I still in love with you? Nah, who am I kiddin'? Give it up, we're through They say if you care for something then set it free If it don't come back, it wasn't meant to be I think about the coulda-beens And how it ended, I'm dependent on your sugar Friends would probably want us to work it out If word of mouth continued They don't know the half of what we've been through They mean well, this is my farewell I'ma cherish the good times If there was a good time to leave it would be now We're just kiddin' ourselves so let's stop If y'all ain't know I'm talkin' 'bout my one and only true love And that's hip-hop, let's go The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danny!

Song: Lost One Typed by: the_divine_2xl@yahoo.com It's not a diss song it's a real song You feel me? [Verse 1] I heard motherfuckers saying they'd ruin Swain But who's playing who when sabotage doesn't do a thing Make the color change in their mood rings Made me question who was really crazy and who's sane Would've stayed with 'em but there wasn't much to gain I put friends over business, niggas was too vain But when friends start to think with a new brain They're kinda like food stains And you gotta get rid of the stupid lames Don't get it twisted not a day passes by That I don't have a single tear fall past my eye It was like three brothers and a sister that I never Had, always bigged each other up, ties got severed Mad, but I guess good friends come a dime a dozen The funny thing is I still love 'em but FUCK 'em Damnit dude, did we really end this over white pants and pointed shoes? Who's disappointing who? Guess what you said was true, really wasn't room for two Superstars so you did what you had to do Brainwashed the crew, we still don't speak One thought for himself but the others is weak They lost one You might win some, but you really lost one You just lost one, it's so silly, how come? When it's all done, did you really gain from What you done done? It's so silly, how come? You just lost one [Verse 2] I don't think it's meant to be, T But she loves her husband more than she does me And honestly, at 33? I would prob'ly love my family more than I did she So we don't speak, just keep excerpts From our relationship at arm's reach, it hurts To pretend it never occurred but I half-forgive her Even though she kicked me to the curb Coped with it the best way I knew Made a song and killed you off, named that shit "Where Were You" Remember when you called me and you said it embarrassed you Made me shake my head at how I had an affair with you 'Cause of you I couldn't let a chick get too close Soon as feelings started to progress I'm like "adios" I swear, you really brought a good man down I didn't think I'd ever pick the pieces and rebound But, Danny's driving 6's now I got riches now Paid back student loans for both of my sisters now I'm doin' real good, I don't miss you now See how life twists around, fucker? You lost one [Verse 3] My father died in his house last June So under the belief he left way too soon Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that tune How much of my conscious can this shit consume? I mean, when he cheated on my mama I wanted to kill him And when he beat me he was treated like one of the villains But even felons get a second chance But with pride sentiments don't get a second glance I was fresh off the plane from the Grammys two years ago My folks had been divorced for some time, just so you know I got a phone call from this nigga like "here we go" Let it go to voicemail cause I don't talk to hoes And that began a pattern of extending himself But all I could remember is him grippin' his belt And smackin' me in the face so his hand I smacked away "That's what you get for breakin' my mama's heart," I'd say So the messages piled up Askin' me if maybe I would like to reconcile what? What is you, crazy? Played 'em back for my friends, we all clowned him Little did I know that my own father was drownin' I got a call and my pops sounded real sick But I was still stiff and wasn't feelin' it As I continued to perfect my raps A month later, I found out that his kidneys collapsed Obituary said he died alone If I had tried to make amends he might have known I had grown, my atonement is too little too late Father forgive me for not starting a new slate Great, I lost one The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danny!

Yeah, I'm so misunderstood, when I'm in the hood  Mindset so far like I'm in the woods He left the game too soon like Tiger Woods If I make a couple million, I'm good They think that I changed since I drive a Bentley I'm still the same man and my brain not empty I still see the hate cause the game is in me They try to take my food cause they say I'm friendly But they don't want no war with the beast that's in me I leave 'em underground, now they life is history Sometimes I feel like the world's against me I keep my head up, stay away from ten feet Keep cool, calm, and collected Jay-Z, you my fam, cause our paths intercepted In New York, respected Live one life so it's always a blessing Misunderstood ain't close to me I'm the definition, I'm the hope you see I came from the bottom, I was broke for free But now I'm on top, you take a note from me But stay humble, if y'all could lose it They say, life's a movie ..Uh, yeah.. we could lose it Life's a movie, I'm misunderstood It's lil bars, the truth definition.. [Danny!] Check it.. Now as I walk into the studio, smokin some hash with Lil B, I get a call from Rick's dad Said his girlfriend Tina, she just went back to rehab But when I heard it, I just looked at my pad Now see on the secondhand, they've already been through a lot When Rick and Tina got together, she been off of that rock for 'bout a year and change, niggas tellin Rick, "You're insane!" But when you love someone enough, you get immune to the pain Now Tina lost her mom and dad when she was young and was orphaned Was raped at seventeen and had to get an abortion She never trusted a soul, but she trusted Rick Persistent little nigga, went to college and shit He saw the beauty in her, but it was never enough Because the taunting and the teasing Rick was doin is too much She didn't wanna put him through that, so she went back to the crack Man... she ain't had to do that! She probably coulda talked to Rick and Rick'll tell her to turn a blind eye to it all like Helen Keller Instead, she let it get to her and now she relapse Two steps forward and three steps back I could've rapped about my hard times to this song.. but heavens know I would've been wrong I wouldn't've been right, y'all wouldn't've cared anyway It wouldn't've been life, it wouldn't've been good So misunderstood [Blu] Ahhhhhh!! She didn't know me, she didn't want to She didn't want to want to want you She told a different story then I'm goin to She kept goin and goin, now I'm gone too I'm in the liquor store, nigga don't fuck with me Tryna get some dope to cope, a blunt and leave I'm thinkin 'bout a better day She told me 'bout it back when I was proud and told me she would see me out another way But she never did, the devil stay Bought a dress walked around my house like she never came, dang Ghostface Killah up in this bitch I got a knife and a bat and a hammer, what's good? I could bust ya shit, cut ya shit  Cripple a nigga, need a crutch and shit Just to get up out the drama I'm appalled by the god in this bitch She think she's Cher, no Sonny she don't even care It ain't funny I'm a bear walk around bare-naked  countin money with a woman bare, naked in the chair  in front of me (What, the...

But now I get it fam, bein overlooked is a drag That's why I take seven years of bein resentful Compose my instrumental, then I drop a classic album on you fags But then... that's when the wack reviews come in When they purposefully deduct a point or two from a ten Like when... you hand in the perfect term paper and the teacher takes away a point for writing in pen It's the same thing cause everybody knows that D.

Nobody told her that the haters smell defeat yo To hear her tell it helpin' someone else's dreams though Is more fulfilling, what she feelin' inside Is pretty obvious to everyone, she's livin' a lie But she don't possess the confidence to give it a try You would figure her fam would be her biggest fans But all they do is insult her and make her quit her plans They tell her "channel that energy try to get a man" So she don't give a damn Throw herself into chores Forever moppin' the floors, until it's spick-and-span How many times you gon' mop that? ...stop that God has better things in store and it's not that [Verse 1: Collette] When in the midst of sorrow You can't see up when looking down A brighter day tomorrow will bring You hear the voice of reason Telling you this can't never be done No matter how hard reality seems You just hold on to your dreams [Bridge: Collette] Don't give up and don't give in Although it seems you never win You will always pass the test [Chorus: Collette] As long as you keep your head to the sky You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky Be optimistic [Verse 2: Danny!] Two kids, Ahmad and Winston Their pops not around so the odds against 'em Their mom workin' three jobs, never stay at home And the younger brother feelin' maybe God resents 'em Girls like the way he makes 'em feel But with a pen he's a pimp for real, no opportunties Bitter brother, always sayin' "poppa ruined me" Never got a phone call, never got annuity Never got a postcard, so that gave him Every reason not to try so hard, he's an ill writer Still tighter than the kids in his class He'd rather sit on his ass cause he don't feel as hyper As everybody steady tellin' him to get away Send out some resumes, all he ever says is "hey, Listen, you guys are buggin' out, while y'all care so much?" It was easier for him to use his dad as a crutch Nowadays, you can find him smokin' grass from a dutch How many times is you gonna get high man?

Album: Cafe Surreal 12" Song: Just Friends Typed by: inspiration4truth@hotmail.com [Verse 1] Cocoa butter colored skin Sexy and smart, with a heart I hope no other brother wins I was smitten ever since, convinced that I belong in your dimension Secretly I long for your attention Retention of thoughts that brought pain to the front of my mind Can't let you slip because you're one of a kind And I wanna make you mine There's no better feeling When affection's got you revealin' Confessions you been concealin' But you wouldn't feel him... Only thing I fear is rejection and death So I figure they're co-related Why would you date him? Could be a school-boy crush Or maybe he ain't tough enough, what could you do with a loser? My views are at worst, delusional At best, quixotic: a product of thoughts unusual I wish I could get through to you, confess my love But we're best friends, and I ain't trying to mess that up So what's the deal y'all [Chorus] - 2X We just friends y'all We just friends y'all We just friends y'all It never ends y'all [verse 2] The only thing worse than love unreciprocated Is coming to grips with it; I hate it Pretty brown young sista, so sophisticated And everytime we joke and kid I know a kiss would make it Squeamish between us; we'd get over it, I'd show you what I mean but Can't handle rejection, got issues with self-esteem and I can't stop the fantasies, nights of illicit dreams I might induce some lucidness, explicit and extreme Lofty thoughts, I'm slick but Not quick enough; picked up bad habits from the hipsters If I can't have you, what's to live for? Until I'm tagged by the coroner I'd rather sit back and bask in your aura As for the former, God forbid I ever pass away Without having the chance to tell you everything I have to say I guess there ain't no changin' destiny Best friends forever, and I guess that's all we'll ever be We're just friends y'all [Chorus] - 2X The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danny! f/ Tanya Morgan Album: Payback Song: Louder Typed by: ilovemattavigian@yahoo.com Put me on, yeah put me on Put me on, yeah put me on Put me on, yeah put me on [Verse 1: Von Pea] Red cups, folding tables Bass so hard, it knocked out the cable Abled bodies move around me Up and down beat, they angry down street Callin' coppers, awful chakra They'd come slower if +I Shot Ya+ Forget them, give them hoes the vodka Ladies wine, six-pack to grandma Doctor, you'll play nurse She's the patient, you go first I got patience, let's rehearse This ain't my house, my town's worse There, we could go ham Turn it up, they won't give a damn Drove in her garage, my Larry Levan Wait, the cops... damn [Chorus] - 2X [Verse 2: Donwill] Somethin' like a frat rap cypher White-boy wasted, pullin' all nighters You can't be serious?
