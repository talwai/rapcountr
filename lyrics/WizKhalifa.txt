watching my moves Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news And true I been runnin' the town Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin All of a sudden, wanting me know Doing research and hunting me down But never mind the stuntin' Trying to see what's on your mind and something Got a place to unwind, it's nothing Have a wild discussion I'm a roll some of this, ride n then puff it Yea,
