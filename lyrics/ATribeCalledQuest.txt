I don't think that is vital for me to be your idol, but dig this recital. If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissin Slingin' this and that, 'cause this and that was missin Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected Afrocentric livin', Africans be givin A lot to the cause 'cause the cause has been risen Some brothers, they be flammin', thinkin' we ain't slammin Comin' off like the days where we used to wear the tans and A blue-colllar talker, a hemisphere stalker A glass of O.J and a ten mile walk-a If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearin Can I get a beep and a side order of cheerin? I am what I am, that's a tribal man We all know the colours, we all must stand As we start our travels, things they will unravel "Que sera sera", for this unit is like gravel Won't be gone for long, listen to the song If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is Chorus: Push it along, push it along. Push it along, yeah, push it along. (repeat 4x) [Phife Dawg] Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher The ills of the world make the situation lighter The clock is always tickin', the systems should be kickin Like ? ham and eggs, I eat chicken, chicken, chicken Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever Embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour? The ?wraughts? of the rap filling up the gap With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap [Q-Tip] The boom, the bip, the boom bip Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty So I ?kick the slash for the gipper? and the witty This ain't trial and error, more like tribe and error Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror The street can't depart from the bloody heart Repair the wear and tear, don't start 'fore it starts Won't be gone for long, listen to the song If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is Repeat chorus [Q-Tip] Marchin' off the project, we hope that you will subject It's good to be an object and never, ever reject The tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda Keep it in boom and never will we slander ? should be handed, don't let me demand it Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it Although she's flippin' crazy, give my love to Gracy God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey? The pigs are wearin' blue, and in a year or two We'll be goin' up the creek in a great big canoe What we gonna do, save me and my brothers? Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers Never will we do that and we ain't tryin' to rule that We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black? This society of fake reality Are nothin' but a peg of informality While I sing my song, sing it all day long, If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is Repeat chorus The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: A Tribe Called Quest Album: People's Instinctive Travels & The Paths Of Rhythm Song: Luck of Lucien Typed by: OHHLA.com [Q-Tip] Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail ? on sale, your rumour starts to wail Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail? They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails (Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?) From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris Came to America to find liberty Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me Oh, luck luck will drive you butt baddy Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could But listen, brother man, I really think you can Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back It's the creme de la creme, and you can bounce with that It'll take a minute, ?rice?, so take my advice Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life Lucine, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know!

[Q-Tip] You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance With the French "savoir faire" and the sexy dance But is she really fly, or is she a guy? I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle? Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little? Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown I had to make the sound, his life is too profound On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup Young and naive, it's hard to believe As long as you're strong, you can quest with the questers Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know!

probably have a batch A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout but with the beer though I had a bout So I exchanged it for some apple juice I had the blues but I shook them loose A jeep is blasting from the urban streets Loots of funk over hardcore beats The moon dabbles in the morning sky As the minutes just creep on by I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe Ritual shakes and in good vibes Like always the Quest begins In the mist though but the rhyth's move in We find a spot and we sit and chat Speaking on the status quo of rap A derelick makes a real long speach We pay attention to the words he read When he was done we rattled on There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn We pointed things out about this times The worlds famons and the crazy crimes Inflation of the nation, it bothers me I better go gold, to pay the taxes Gotta be swift society The man whose made is the man who maxes The grounds for living are being discussed As we go it gets close to dusk Gather thoughts and savor breath Cause there's only a few hours left Chorus: After Hours it was cool (x8) Q-Tip: Me ohh my, hey-hey, hey-hey The human hours are here to stay This is how it seems(?) my witness Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this Girls be screaming on this conversation I have my two cents for a revelation And my watch continuously tic-tocs Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles A car revs up and I hear it trottle It probably moves with the morning wind Ohh my God, here's Phife again (?) talking about last nights game Trying to remember someone's name So hear the frogs dancing in the streets Once again Ali will bring up the beat Like this (Sounds of frogs) Q-Tip: The beat is over and so is the night The sun is risen and the shine is bright We all say peace and go our separate ways Youth is fading as we gain our days Expedition for the song is simp' The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp As we go you hear a gasp of laugh As we

of life that be shovin out the door that's crack The valleys of time, are always on my feet As least the beat will combine The calluses and corns with the funky bassline You don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat Well can I get a level on the bass and on the treble Footin up and down like a UNLV Rebel The answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics Can't be too much flackin, not too much packin You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap Your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted This ain't rock 'n' roll cos the rap is in control If you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car I'd rather go barefootin, for prints I will be puttin all over the earth if we can get there

you want protection you can hide behind the shield [Q-Tip] You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock But we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail See the levels peakin as the rhythms keep-a screechin A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preachin the point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far The loudiness is ringin as we scoot across the star We are bulgin, I'm indulgin in a rat-a-tat-tat Explanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep But dig it in the ground because the foot print now [Q-Tip] If there's a storm that's brewin, it won't keep us from doin our thing as we start swingin, travellin is bringin joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place When you get your finger on the music it'll linger Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that Remember me, the brother who said "Black is black" You can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress Get emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best Makin moves, makin motions, flowin like an ocean The walkin will continue, we know that we will bring you the times that you have waited, more anticipated Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: A Tribe Called Quest Album: People's Instinctive Travels And The Paths of Rhythm Song: I Left My Wallet in El Segundo My mother went away for a month-long trip Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship She made a big mistake by leaving me home I had to roam so I picked up the phone Dialed Ali up to see what was going down Told him I pick him up so we could drive around Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 My mother left a yard but I needed one more Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit Came to a toll, we paid and went through it Had no destination, we was on a quest Ali laid in the back so he could get rest Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half The sun had just risen on a dusty path Just then a figure had caught my eye A man with a sombrero who was four feet high I pulled over to ask were we was at His index finger he tipped up his hat "El Segundo," he said, "my name is Pedro If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto" Needed civilization, some sort of reservation He said a mile south, there's a fast food station Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor Ali said, "Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?" (Well describe to me what the wallet looks like) Anyway a gas station we passed We got gas and went on to get grub It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere Anywhere would have been better I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em Ali had the fruit punch When we finished we thought for ways to get back I had a hunch Ali said, "Pay for lunch" So I did it Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady She was a waitress there Put the wallet down and stared and stared To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed: "Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?" I checked for keys and started to step  What do you know, my wallet I forget Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers  Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man Lord, have mercy The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me I fell bad but he makes me feel badder Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound Jettin' on down at the seepd of sound Three days coming and three more going We get back and there was no slack 490 Madison, we're here, Sha He said, "All right, Tip, see you tomorrow" Thinking about the past week, the last week Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack Of Shaheed, "We gotta go back" when he said "Why?" I said, "We gotta go 'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo" Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo Left my wallet in El Segundo Left my wallet in El Segundo I gotta get, I got-got ta get it The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: A Tribe Called Quest f/ Red Alert Album: People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm Song: Pubic Enemy Typed by: mrmaj@juno.com Red Alert: Check this out, Cool DJ Red Alert With my man, Q-Tip Q-Tip: In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures Looked at her sexual partner Who acquainted her acquaintance Five hours ago at a disco She went lower than low, into limbo A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo She answered no, so she had to go...on with the program Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name But it seems that she's done the same And now something has happened Suddenly, she's been distracted By something that has been attracted She poked and poked and smacked at it Then she broke down and she scratched it Now, I think you understand Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps Then he picked up a pair of forceps Her pretty face showed fright Right then and there, she fainted A really grim picture is painted The brotha who she acquainted Was the enemy, scary ain't it?

No wonder she surround you. Look at you. Your brown eyes pierce just like a knight,  make afella think real hard about the rest of his life. The whole *shit* is strange. I'm really thinkin' brains but on the other hand, I really feel your stress and pain. Flimsy little men, they can't command you and they don't have the heart to demand you, but niether do I. I guess I'll let you walk on and watch 'cause your walk is strong. Sippin' passion wit' a stranger in the club,  it doesn't necessarily equate to love. It's not really in the air, I wanna take it elsewhere Somethin' wild that 'chu can't compare. Bangin' on my wood drum now Hope your hearin' all the sound. Now, *nigga*, come now. Sittin' at home, a hat in my hand  while you crawlin' on the earth with your natural tan. Your than is jigg-i-lin' and causin' a stir.  Let's do it real rough until life is a blur. I suit you the way that 'chu want. Hey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. It caught me the way that 'chu want. ("Uh, uh, uh.") Hey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. ("Check it out, now.")

But you shine and you pay it no mind, always stayin' on the grind with the thangs you do. You got the illest little switch and you  ain't takin' no *shit* 'cause nobody wanna *fuck* wit' 'chu. Admiration to the utmost.  All my dogs raise your cups 'til the girl toast. I don't wanna bring shame to you really, I wanna put flames to you sincerly. Make your box-spring jump like a low rida. Best place that I could be is inside ya. The love that we have could be real  but you gotta go by what your heart feels. Heart feels. Heart feels. Heart feels. Heart feels. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, come on. I suit you the way that 'chu want. Hey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. It got me the way that 'chu want. ("Uh, uh, uh.")

E'rybody's a star, e'rybody shine ("Shine. Shine. Shine...") Follow your heart and not mankind. ("Kind. Kind. Kind...") For real, for real. I'm 'bout to do my thing to shine. Said everybody shine. C'mon." It's not luck that I'm sittin' here spittin' for y'all. Preeld in by Allah that I'm hittin' for y'all. Growin' up on the New York concrete lookin' lilke a little snotty dish of prodigy cookin'. They called me Little Man all in the boulevard. When I was young, my family used to party hard. Gangs of uncatched kids turned to blood ketchup. The illest niggas was Richard Pryor and Ronnie Bump. Skinned knees from being bad-ass little boys. Police si-re-ns and baby screams was average noise. Hip-Hop came, the ghetto copped the soundtrack. Street poetry to tracks, could you beat that? Malik Taylor introduced it to me.  He said, 'Forget Benny Hill, nigga. Let's M.C.!' Twelve years old, rhymin' in the backroom. For echoes, we used to rhyme in the bathroom. Run-D.M.C., Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh. The Juice Crew rule but who's this nigga KRS? Reference points, too many to wish for. Battlin' niggas on trains, I stay raw. Never let my dream die.  I was happy and high goin' to Alee's and Bed-Stuy We made our first demo tape.  Ex-cited like a mawfucka, lookin' for our first break. I knowwwwwwwwww... ("F'real.") you can do it. Be abidin', chy'all. ("Listen to the story I tell, yo. F'real.") I knowwwwwwwwww... ("Don't let 'em hate to front you.") you can see it.  ("Get up and follow me and flow again. Use my life as an example.") Do it, and see it, and be nobody else! Jungle Brothers, De La, they gave me little light. In Top, Three Feet, Buddy, that was aiiight. One year later, the Tribe was initiated. Bonita came, it was wild how she dominated. Can I Kick It parled us to our next phase. So drunk in those days, I truly was amazed how I got up enough to make tunes. People cheered me. It was Foreign, then came Low End Theory. People quickly reconized who we are, Phife is ill and Busta is a superstar. Tours with P.E., Naughty, and the Geto Boys. Arsenio Hall, women then were evil toys. Whisperin' hate inside my brother's virgin ears. Tryin to hurt but, yo, we stood amongst the tears. Midnight was even tighter, now look at us. Condoms is on the rida stored on the bus. It got funky right here, I had to save my life. In the snow after the show, I had a fight wit' Phife. Moves to a land to get away but back home job was urkin' us, it sent me throuh a danger zone. The good thing, I found Allah in the process. An angel appeared wit' sneaky ways and gave me stress. Now what am I to do? My album's platinum but I'm still feelin' blue. C'mon. Yeeeeeeeeeeeah. Yeeeeeeeeeeeah. Yeeeeeeeeeeeah. ("You can do it.") Yeeeeeeeeeeeah. Yeeeeeeeeeeeah. ("I knowwww.") Yeeeeeeeeeeeah.  Yeeeeeeeeeeeah. ("You can see it.") Yeeeeeeeeeeeaeeeeeeaaaeeeeeah. Makin' my way, the wilderness has grown fierce. Redemption and my heart, both of them was pierced. Crashed my truck, didn't think I'd make it out. Had a hit on my life, he thought I screwed his wife! Plus my house burned down, me and Ands was in it. My crew was tired and I knew we had to end it. But through all of this, I'm still here.  Take notes and let hope floats.  I'm still here. Take note and let hope float.    | I knowwwwwwwwww... I'm still here. Take notes and let hope float.  You can do the same shit that I'm doin'.    | you can do it.

We always are trying to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens...but if we look within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. It's about relating back to the essence, where it all stems from. I'm-a do my thing over this drum, like a native tongue. Verse one Q-Tip: Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real complicated with the skills over reel to reel brown skin is what i feel, my mind and body's appeal is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill constantly, I'm hearing Black Americans just sneering Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either Hitting us up with great emotional chat about the fact that the black is constantly held back Like 50 tracks back in a relay race and the white team's ahead so let's keep up the pace And I be needing something To feed my logical taste At the end of the race is there a paradise place? Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing Material gain we put too much in persuing "Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party" But we can all mardi grati Minus that shit in our body "What that got to do with that" 'Cause kid that's the essence, your physical presence embodies every lesson You can't run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted. Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard. What we need to do first  Now listen to this verse Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate. Recognize your existence in this vast blue space From a tiny cloud of blood To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell and sound Let's deem it profound! And prioritize this cause it was Allah's wish "Allah? I'm God" "No I ddon't believe that. That's a mystery" "If God is so good why does shit be happening to me?" There's divinity within because we come from the divine A froce that's not seen But you feel it every time When the wind blows, and the world turns,  and the rain drops, and the baby cries and the bird flies, and the ground quake, and the stars gleam So many things are eident of its existence What we need to do is link it with persistence Once we recognize that, we can move ahead Native Tongue, Common Sense yo he's Hip-Hop bred... Common: From the spiritual world my former life has developed First person I lost close to me was Stella Some of my mellows Lost their mothers and their brothers For them I feel empathy But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas I pour my heart out when I see Dot out on the deck Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news But when it's somebody you know it hits you and emotions get bruised I ain't been in your shoes,  I won't judge you for knocking Because the spirit of the ghetto says "You Gotta!"

My Dj spin the music down to the nitty gritty. When the downstairs funky five days a week. Searching and seeking for the Baby Bam beat. The Afrikan rap that comes from within us. Brothers heard about it now they wish they could've been us. We did an album with no problem. No we working on another with another Jungle Brother. [Me] Q-tip, his name, he's into business, not into games So Q-tip when the light turns green, grab your bone and show them what I mean. My bone is grabbed, this is what I mean. I brag a grab, and here's the scene. Q-tip, [Q-tip] from a Tribe Called Quest,  Saw the Jungle Brother's album, oh yes. So get the ducats it's coming out soon. A month after March, two before June, It's nice. With Ali Shaheed Mohammed, my Dj who Is real dominant. [Mohammed, Mohammed] He and I form the funky Tribe. If you want to get with it, just feel the vibe. [Feel the vibe] Me and Ali are extremely radiant. And to be heard like the horn of Gideon. Get it? If not you're a goner. Get wise or get something, cause your going to want to. Lamp, after you hear from me. The Tip from Quest my Dj's Ali. Say it from the Catskills, to the Soho. Listen to the words they say on the Promo. To the bewildered, Let it be said. I'll mix you up more like DJ Red So Mike G, when the light turns red, Don't stop, proceed ahead. Go on with your, Go on with your, Go on with your, Bad self. Well, I'm going [Where?] Straight to the treetop. Eating crazy fruit, so I can't stop. Squating here, listen to the LP. Straight Out The Jungle from the JBs. Baby Bam beat keeps the bass bottom bouncing. Suckers littering, girls ouncing,  Women inching, girls pinching. Run to the record store to see if (???) is in. Remixes, outfixes, we write it, you like it. Rap music, house music. No matter what it is, the JBs can do it. Oh ya, (etc.) It's coming (x4) How much is it? 5.99? ahh just bring a 20, bring a twenty.

[Talib Kweli] Yo, I keep a smile on my face, even when it's looking very grim I think about them babies innocent like cherubim I'm livin' in an era when There is more black people owning things than it's ever been In America. From small banks to big labels Properties, and businesses even stations on cable Still we're not able To control the money (There's) Swine still on the table And ghettos across the country Our babies stay hungry, but we got black senators in congress That's the illusion of pro-gress Gettin' hype when you see blacks on TV is plain dumb When them cats don't understand where they came from Let's get everybody's head nodding to the same drum Then have conversations that cross generations It's then and only then you will see That these kids imitate images from the seventies That's the decade we were born into Conforming to The code of the pimp and the playa, what you wanna do? Call that man "Ghouli-ani" Said, "We've got no clue", pro'bly Forget about the Q-Tip's, Mos Def's, Talib Kweli's The mind state of those before us seem pathetic Got the nerve to say my generation apathetic But I don't sweat it I just choose to assist Boo-hoo all you want, just continue to exist Refuse any fact that's not actual Resist anything that's not natural Refuse to let the current situation worsen Resist anybody's that disrespecting your person Refuse to be afraid, it's only God you should fear Resist the temptation to act like you don't care It's a struggle out there And we all feel the pressure You say it's all good, I wanna make it all better [Mos Def] They say that illegal business control America The law man long arm is just a long barrell There ain't a black butterfly Black birds and sparrows, anything trying to fly Their response to more black is more blue and more ammo Check the local news channel The commissioner, the defendent is kin Another long winded lie again Black folks gonna die again When they say "we" they really mean us and them The politics of division Creating fresh revenue for prison It's money, it's religion They been running the same type of game Since the slave holders settled the plane It's very little remains The capital gains Control the domain Closing the vain So life can't circulate Perpetrate the murder rate Para military Killin' Mary That's the seed they sow They gotta bleed to grow But what they need to know That what you reap Is what you keep. Payblack is better fruit to eat It uproot the teeth Enough to make the laughing ? stop smiling They took him to the grave, but Lazarus was unsilent (3x) [Q-Tip] Yo, yo, it's the doughnuts and coffee That makes you too bossy I really don't think you need to be walking the beat And targeting civilians 'cuz we're walking in the streets Refrain from prejudice and refrain from eating sweets Constitution's not made Ffor multi-raced slaves There's more than Amadu who found a way to early grave Gonna keep on happenin' and Police is packin' and Giuliani's yappin' and You know the process Cops is drinkin' beer on the street's, relieve stress Looking for the lucky Latino w/ black face Keeping us inside a place But it's not about race Let 'em tell it. And a lot of y'all police is punks Smackin' hustlers up and confiscating all their junk Sellin' it back, scaring the cats into submission Bustin' at the brothas 'cuz we fit the description Of the young and intelligent Often wild talented Ghetto child. Our dreams are snatched up w/ violence, kid Gonna make you feel the pain if I can It's the ordinary thing just a day for the man (3x) [Talib Kweli] Refuse any fact that's not actual Resist anything that's not natural Refuse to let the current situation worsen Resist anybody's that disrespecting your person Refuse to be afraid, it's only God you should fear Resist the temptation to act like you don't care It's a struggle out there And we all feel the pressure You say it's all good, I wanna make it all better The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Nas f/ Ken Staton, Sadat X, Q-Tip (A Tribe Called Quest) Album: From Illmatic to Stillmatic - The Remixes Song: One Love (L.G.
