Verse Two: These crazy thoughts in my head won't stop Where's my moms and my pops and what about hip-hop I'm pickin up things that could be of use to me Too build a makeshift crib where Hollywood used to be And it ain't no forties, it ain't no blunts I ain't had no ass in five years and eight months Five more years pass, and I still survive And I'm through with wonderin who's still alive Until one day I'm just walkin along And I hear this kid singin a hip-hop song He said, "That's the way it is, and it's like that" I said, "Yo kid c'mere, where you learn that song at?" He said, "My daddy taught me about the hip-hop game I'm eight years old and Rakim is my name" He said, "Yo I'll take you to him, come follow me; but first you gotta prove that you can MC" So I cleared my throat got in a b-boy stance and I ran through a rhyme that made him piss in his pants With tears in his eyes, he grabbed me by the hand And then we ran, ten miles across the sand He took me to the spot, dig deep underground Where I can hear the sound of the big bass pound I wasn't really sure, but I swore we smelled blunt smoke No joke loc, well can I get a toke? He took me to his pops and he handed me a spliff And out behind the wall came Tash and E-Swift They took me to a freestle session it was on I knew hip-hop would never be gone FIve hundred hip-hop deep Yo we cool in 2014, Alkaholiks still rulin Ooutro: It's gonna live forever This goes out to the P-Town, LBNT KnowhatI'msayin?

single The one he bit the oldie track and stole the oldie jingle jangle, but I be comin from a different angle Cause I want that pot of gold below the hardcore rainbow But name your price and you'd be down to sell your moms I'm on a different level while the Devil grease your palms Sign your life away in ink, cause you think you got the talents But look at Hook's bank account and zero is the balance I repeat, ze-ro, peo-ple Cause he be worried bout his hook so he could get a spin from [------] [-----] but Rico, blow them type niggaz through the rooftop Cause [------] only plays you if you

make it look so simple Cause deep inside my mental I got stacks of lyrics hidden That's why I get the props that Captain Hooks don't be gettin Plus they be counterfeitin, styles straight scandals Spendin too much time tryin to party off the handle I bust to Orlando, tryin to better what I got (why) Cause I'm Tash the likwifyer here to take somebody's spot But not that nigga named Captain Hooks Cause he's the type of rapper, that's always worried bout his looks But overnight success don't impress the West that's freshest He need to take his cheese and invest in rappin lessons Or catch one for free right here on me Or catch me late Friday night on 92.3 And after lesson three, if his style still stank I'ma tie his ass up and make him walk the plank Chorus Verse Three: J-Ro I was in my Likwid cruise ship, just sailin the seas When Captain Hook came and stole my steez Oh Hook, caught a left hook, for stealin my hook In no time he stole a rhyme out my notebook I'm the the Pacific Ocean, floatin Chasin his broken ass out to Oakland But WhoRidas said he came and stole they name And he got E-40's briefcase full of game So I, set myself back on the Ro's quest With the Farrahey brew up in the crow's nest He could see L.A., there was trouble you see Oh shit, he just stole a flow from WC Now he's throwin up the dub I gotta catch the fuckin scrub He'll go down like a sub cause I'ma cut him like a shrub He wants pub, yeah, he's all on Blass He moved real fast on Snoop and Ras Kass Chorus (J-Ro instead of Tash in the first half) Verse Four: J-Ro Now I'm in Atlanta, and his trail is hotter than a sausage I'm took late, he took Outkast out as a hostage I wonder could he squab with the Goodie MoB I think he got the best of me, just how many would he rob I floated out to Queens but it seems I just missed him They said he robbed Cool J for his boomin system He went to Shaolin and stole Method Man's bio and he buried everything somewhere in Ohio Bone Thugs saw him, at the Crossroad with a empty treasure chest that he was tryin to load He was last seen sailin, into the distance We gotta catch this crook and we need your assistance Yeah, if you happen to see this punk scallywag out there Don't try to aprehend him, just call Tha Liks And if you suddenly got some rhymes missin, you know who did it Captain Hook, yeah we gon catch his ass Baten down the

*radio skippping* Episode #2: God's Gift I have no strings to hold me down Beware of the tupperware It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain Who came complete with all terrain capabilities Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely Beyond the vanity of border ampedence hindering Progress intending to enhance those plagued with Recessive styles, relying on primal rage Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material Virtually there, but still visually impaired Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook Confusing ya confidence, cuz you dwell on surface knowledge Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed Like locusts consuming all vegetation Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming The surviving population as mass retations Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentations On the island of Madlib Monroe CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs *radio

the spot when Medaphoar's near My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop Chorus: Oh No Cuz everyday it's like a level in this game that we live Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll But don't step to Oh No, because your rhymes will be fold [Oh No] In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria That's some next shit, material starts external But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior Some niggas know me as "Oh No" But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm "on ya ho" So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rhumatism Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up Kaliwild shakin up the best, messin 'em up This nigga's known as

style while giving that girl erection Wildchild's up in your face always promoting protection I got this relation wit this girl in my section Word is bond Yeah she's my way out so I seek no infection [Madlib] Gold digger higgers playing like miss dj vu Running round talking bout you use to stay by who Causing problems but my problem solver is more like a revolver Lyrically lounge mode Is like chillin wit my boo I'm blew wit two hits Then pass and stay true Rolling out wit my crew Back stabbing benefits never hit my way cause I always parlay Tell the brothers to bust protection in any selection [Loot Pack] Since you got it like that baby doll I got it good Hook me up one time and make it feel real good If you make me feel nice not once maybe twice Dim the lights one time breakout the Alize on ice That's right Yeah you got it good baby We can hook up anywhere anytime or day Most brotha's try to think of dope lines to say We treat women with respect like a real lady [Madlib] When Madlib The bad kid Only had one selection Plant my seed and live life with out trife and deceptions Living out the Cali wild brothers running mad game Some people flock cause they are all on that fame But I don't pay it no mind Get in that gossip You want to floss it Head trips is gonna process hectic Female brains sustain like hexes Genetics who said it cause I'm like in it to win it [Wildchild] We keep it real while brothers try to interpertate lyrical skills Ninety six get use to a condiment that miracle pill Those that are not one hundred percent effective my main objective Is to push forth knowledge in the youth so they stay mad protected Don't prove me wrong Unprotection is really not good for your health The reason you get caught what you do is cause you carry yourself Quite unwisely not thinking about your outcome Loot Pack not teachin but reaching out like Malcolm [Loot Pack] Since you got it like that baby doll I got it good Hook me up one time and make it feel real good If you make me feel nice not once maybe twice Dim the lights one time breakout the Alize on ice That's right Yeah you got it good baby We can hook up anywhere anytime or day Most brotha's try to think of dope lines to say We treat women with respect like a real lady Ha ha got it good baby lootpack bitch for all the ladies out there ha all the cheap The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: LootPack f/ God's Gift Album: Lost Tapes Song: Undisciplined Typed by: antdogg_711@yahoo.com Undisciplined kids don't cut it  You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz don't cut it Undisciplined kids don't cut it You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz are hopeless  [God's Gift] Yo You can't control your own soul so how you gonna roll against what god sent I tip off rappers in honesty  The irony is  Harassing me is blasphemy How you get the god a challenge when you off balance physically and spiritually  I raise above the clouds in a hurry But if you want me  I'll just kick you down earthly Now mostly I flows ufo styles cause the universe is our trial  But I'm versital I can't correct your style deflects the fect you rejects  Might holt your freedom is my right to be righteous  Not toxicated  By toxic toxins I tox the skin  With pure chase intentions  [well who you be yo] The rest oppress bills stress in the blood The fresh in the flesh is gods gift unplugged  The slaughter kids immoderate  When I'm on the microphone you stop, look, and learn so you gets the most out of it Direct from area fifty one  Stomps on more techniques  I freak the Madlib beats  Wack styles get destroyed so you best believe when I rush MC's they can't avoid When I bust that asteroid So you're a gangsta cool but on the mic yo what's the difference  Off the top can you drop rhythmatic metaphorical flows for instance  Naw I didn't think so You're just like all the floppy sloppy who like to kick back and copy  Like you were Kinko's  Sampling zap tracks  Only reason why the crowd claps  Covers up the fact your raps whack  So I chill  Wondering when the miracle will  Bring it to your senses mentally and  Physically bring out your lyrical skill  Ha  This common sense sell out ish   You be devoted  How it turned into a hit I don't know  Why it gets promoted is where the concern lies  And visine clears my eyes So if you ever leave the country I suggest return wise  Ha In hip hop we don't stop to rock a joint  So we point out whack emcees so rap audience sees my point  Not the baddest nigga  I never smoke but had a swigga  I'm the thinnest one with lyrics that have the fattest figure  Ha Undisciplined kids don't cut it  You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz don't cut it Undisciplined kids don't cut it You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz are hopeless Undisciplined kids don't cut it  You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz don't cut it Undisciplined kids don't cut it You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz are hopeless
