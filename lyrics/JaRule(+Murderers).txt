I didn't know that me touchin would lead to her catchin feelings I'm serious and I'm so sincere, my object is to stay in the clear Cause we find, fuck, then flee, these broads 'round here I done made so many women shed so many tears Sittin home all alone gettin drunk off of shots of Patron Decided to call, let her feelings be known in a slurred tone She said "I always get what I want and all I want is you" But I don't get it cause [Ja Rule] Girl our situation is getting a little out of my hands You calling me constant tellin bitches that I'm your man I thought we was just friends conversating Getting to know one another on a friendly basis Lets face it, we from two different worlds that don't collide But when they do the crash is small like a facade Your favorite season is Beghotti and mine is Summer You use credit I rubberband wrap my hundreds We got in common is minumum right next to nothing And I think thats what subliminally keeping you coming Back to the one you been fuckin but never thought you'd be fuckin How often do you think about akwardness of it? I know you love it to say the least and I ain't just sayin That contrary to some beliefs I possess a track And my track record is something to be expected Money, Cash, Hoes you know how it goes [Ja Rule] Who would've thought that somethin so simple Would turn out to be detrimental Now I'm feelin like I'm caught in the middle of this love triangle, between she, me and reality And reality is tellin us that we could never be Cause I come from the streets and you come from a rich family But I don't think that yo' family would understand me It's just them little things you overlook when you around me Drugs, guns, bitches and needless to say You're a pimp in your own way, baby you're makin it hard For me to look you in your eyes and tell you to move on I'm hone (I'm hone) but then I'm back again Money and good pussy is a +Fatal Attraction+ for me She hits me everynight quarter past 10 And with every call her voice got a little more tense Now we involved, and it really don't make no sense So be careful what you ask for you just might get it BIOCTH!!!
