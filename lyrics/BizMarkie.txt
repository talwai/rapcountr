Go up your nose and pick yourself a winner" Pickin' Boogers (4x) Let me tell you what happened on the train, man I was coolin' one say with my partner Kane Headed up to the Rooftop, ridin' the D train When the man sittin' next to me was so profane He'd stick his finger up his nose, then do a drain (You should 'a moved) I was just about, but al of a sudden, homeboy just pulled out a big green slimy nah I'm not neven gonna say it but it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it he sat there for a while with it in his hand so I tried to play cool and like ignore the man so I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap all of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke but a brother like BizMarkie had almost choked so I dug up my nose and pulled out about five and plucked every last one of them dead in his eye then the man jumped up and said "what's wrong with you" and wiped them off his face and said "I can't mess with you" like if I did something that was so full of shame but yo you got to know the name of the game Pickin' Boogers (4x) Hmmm.... now let me take a trip down memory lane back in public school with my partner Kane when I was class clown, and he was my brother sittin' at the desk pluckin' boogers at each other never doin' work as we was supposed cause we was too busy diggin' up our nose and in the lunchroom you would talk about rude God forbid the person that'd leave his food no matter who you are we didn't give a damn we even put teachers down with the program whether if it was a woman or if you a man we put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand catch anyone from anywhere but the best fun about it catchin' Kane out there especially when we playin' ball in the gym I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him now we're grown up and things have changed but we still be playin' the pickin' boogers game just last night, when Kane was gettin' ready I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti Pickin' Boogers (4x) Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl... one night at Latin Quarters I was standin' at ease I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez I didn't show enough that I really did want it So, no half steppin', I pushed up on it Pulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat had a spotlight beamin' on my BizMarck hat but when she stepped in the light and she got real close I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose she was dressed real def and her body was hooked but that dried up booger just ruined her look I wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold so I played if off and said "that's a cute green mole" I was hopin' from that she would wipe it away but she didn't do nothin' I guess she wanted it to stay I said before you get my number, I don't mean to diss you but write it in your hand because your gonna need the tissue The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Biz Markie Album: Goin' Off Song: Albee Square Mall Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch [ VERSE 1 ] On the mic at this time in the place to be I'm the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie That made you dance, make the music with my mouth, and all But I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn Where I can be found if you're lookin For me, the B-i-z, so just come check me out Cause 24/7 I'm mikin the house So when I come in the Mall, and then I start to roam You wouldn't think it's a store, you would think it's my home Cause when I come in the place, then I hang up a sign Reads 'home sweet home' - this house is mine [ T.J.

Threw her the Kool-Aid smile, and a dash of charm I stepped to the lady and tapped her arm But when she turned around, my smile turned to gloom She didn't look none like she looked across the room She had big broad shoulders and her titties was big They were filled with silicone, and her hair was a wig She had more makeup than Boy George and Phyllis Diller Ugly enough to be a monster in "Thriller" Had hair on her chest longer than King Spade Even though I got a band, I don't need the AIDS So I hurried out and left, she said, "Please stay" I said, "Sorry money grip, I don't go that way" So I stepped out in a hurry, to gather my wits And thought that's a damn shame, he had nice tits And that's the last I ever saw of Kim You wanna know why?

As long as me and V be makin up the beats You will hear people sayin - "I hear music" Cool V, give me a drum roll [Verse Three] This is the ending, conclusion, kapiche? Of this new hip-hop masterpiece About people countin chickens before they're hatched Recollatin on somethin that they can't match They're creatin sounds of a hip-hop human bein Whether you're American or European Or even if you're from the West or East coast I'd like to thank all of you, save the most Don't diss each other by sayin who's better Just do it the best way, and stick together With different rhyme techniques and DJ cuts And be crazy ambitious, and have a lot of guts And the people buyin, thanks for your support Cause if it wasn't for you, we'd all fall short As long as there's radio, cars and jeeps You know what you will hear? What, what? What, what what what what? Yo V, yo yo what what what what what what what you hear? I can't hear you man, scratch it up one mo' time! Yo what you hear?

[Biz Markie] Subject one is about a brother by the name of John Who was sellin crack, just like it was Avon And you know y'know the reason I say "was" Because that's no longer what my man John does There was a time when he was wearin much gold Drivin a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties Cause he would make dough-roll, and swing it like a yo-yo Bein broke, was just a no-no But then the day came when John got caught And he was dropped like pantyhose without support You shoulda thought about, what you did in the past To realize, this fast livin wouldn't last But, the same guy that was a big hoodlum Is now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him [Chorus - kids singing 4X] Things get a little easier Once you learn to understand it [Biz Markie] Subject two, and this one is a doozy A messed up story about a girl named Suzy Now when you're on WIC, the problems may seem enough But you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up On a crack mission, no type of ambition Make blunts disappear better than a magician Her eyes got dim, her body got slim She said there's nothin in the world like a good ol' stem On and like on and, and it was strong Grabbed her pipe and sung a song "I want to get HIGH.. so high!" "I want to get HIGH.. so high!" She'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her Then hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha Bum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation Put it all together for a perfect combination I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with the very last dime she got in her pocket And when she saw her friends, comin from the spot Like Prudential, she got a piece of their rock That's why [Biz Markie] Subject three, finally, the E-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie She used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose of curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother And boy did the B-I-Z love her But then.. {*singing*} those.. were.. the.. DAYS My friend.. we thought they'd never end And she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie But then she got on drugs Started wearin extensions and rugs And let me tell you what say happened to Marie {*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot Everytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot Her hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body And her underarms kickin like the ho know karate Her clothes are real dirty, and usually the same As for money she don't have a dime to claim Because when I saw the girl the other day She was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway [Chorus] - fades out The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: BizMarkie Album: I Need a Haircut Song: Road Block Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash Yo Doc, drop the beat in!

I told you.. I'ma give you one incedent from my past when I had short money, goofy pants off my ass I used to go to block parties my cousin had served and see how people who made it, kicked OTHERs to the curb And then I said if I was in their spotlight I would treat everybody, equally right To get where I'm at now, I used to hand out flyers From school to school, for New York and L.I.ers It was me and Mike from Ike and then they used to do it He said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it So I kept at it, cause it was hard work I told em I was makin a record, they gave me a smirk like if I was incapable of doin the deed or virtually impossible for me to succeed You must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue Only thing that I can tell you is I told you.. I told you..

He done ROBBED my damn house again, yo that kid is buck wild.." Yo, I don't know whassup, but he be BUGGIN word up Yo that yo.. I'm just sayin like this I don't whassup, but I think you will understand a little bit more of the situation I'ma say like he would say it, on this second part So just check this out aight? Just kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head He was a crook -- at the age of nine Do whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND Snatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men way back WHEN.. when he was only ten Then when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade Tried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid And if he ever had to travel somewhere far Take a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR! He'd always choose to live his life the wild way Tag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play His moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High the way you live determine just how soon you die And he didn't care because to him it was fun and he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun He robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently Gave a new name to juvenile delinquency And yeah you know that, he, was on the go Seven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough But he was headed for a dead end fast Cold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last Went back and forth to jail six times for stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes So when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child it don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild.. Ay that that that's a little bit of a lesson for all the kids out there you know now Yeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin And this is comin from The Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler Ain't no one cooler In 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah who used to wear his pants up to his chest And I want you to just listen cause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild..

Beauty's only skin deep, ugly is to the bone Back in the days, I'm not gonna lie They used to say I'm ugly, a hurting guy They would crack on my lips, and my powder Saying I look like yuck without the house or ?Wig Howard? >From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded Just because the way I looked, they said I farted I was very very sad and you wonder why Because my looks and my gear wasn't ultra fly I wouldn't even attempt to ask a girl out Cause she get around her friends and began to shout" "Guess who asked me out to the movies girlfriend It was Mark, I told him if the world would end" But my parents told me beauty's only skin deep If that's true then why do girls think that I'm a creep? I even joined the football team to get some recognition But that didn't spark the key in a girl's ignition They said I'm so ugly I give Anican a headache Aw man, that is the icing on the cake! So I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts I don't care what you think, cause you all are nuts 	I'm an ugly nigga, so what? 	If you don't like the way I look, you can kiss my butt 	I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? Ewwwww   (Repeat 2x) I'm a tell you story that's really bugged About a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs In the begining before he got his riches He was so ugly, he gave me the itches I mean, if you see him, you think I might be kooky But homeboy looked like, um, God-zooky I used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star And everybody laughed when I said "Mon-star" I can't laugh now because it's a new decade My guzu-friend got the girls and got it made I guess having jewels, having money, having a vehicle Makes you sexy, handsome, gorgeous, and adorable When you're spending money, giving girls what they want Behind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front Why do you go to bed with someone that you don't like Just because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike It would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking Thinking that he look like, um, Stinking Jenkins But let me tell you a secret, he has ESP And this is what he whispered in my ear to me 	I'm an ugly nigga, so what? 	Just because I got loot, that's why you give me the butt? 	I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what?     (Repeat 2x) 	Let me tell you how poor I was Dome to the doo, and doo to the dome For the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb Now people always ask how are these things known Cause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home That's why I keep a pick in my knappy fro And for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy joe But at night I be starving, like Messy Marvin I get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain They offer me a lot in the army But I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army Cause times are getting harder than boot camp Man I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp So if my hooptie breaks down, I just have to suffer And tell Minekie "I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler!" So I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run But even on the beaches, they call me a beach bum Something ain't right with me, and that really frightens me Cause nowadays girls don't even like to sprighten me Some say I'm embarassing, but I got some comparison Like if I was on TV, I would be Oscar Madison Is there another like me? Only God knows Man I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes But for now I'm just going to do the strut And this is what I say to girls from houses to huts 	I'm an ugly nigga, so what?

You never saw a young man drive a Range Rover?" He let me go and said, "Don't do it again" - "Why," I said, "thank you officer, you been a nice guy" So I stopped at the store to get somethin to drink Guess what happened to me before I could blink They had my truck in the air, just about to be towed For $700 in tickets I owed [Verse 3: Biz Markie] After all that I could finally go home And rest my feet and get on the telephone I had a unbelievable time in the city I shoulda be down with the ( ? ) committee I tried to cook some dinner but it came out burnt The fire was too hot, I just had learned So freak it, I'll go to a restaurant I brought a girl with me, asked, "What do you want?" "Shrimp and lobster, two bottles of Aliz" I looked at her and said, "Hey hey hey!" She ate all the food and drank all of the liquor I better bring her home so I can stick her So I got her to my house as fast as I can This is like takin candy out of a baby's hand But when I got her to my room, without no doubt She was so intoxicated that she passed out The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Biz Markie Album: Friends EP Song: Come Party * Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch [* alternate version of Party to the Break-A-Day off the Weekend Warrior LP] [Verse 1: Biz Markie] Hey, how you're doin, it's me The unforgettable incredible B -i-z M-a-r-k-i with the e I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali The way I get down you'll say "Damn, the B-i-z always makes my day" My style is untangible when you hear Cause the brother on the mic is most debonnaire On the DJ tip I'm like savoir-faire Cause you can probably find me anywhere I'm the best from the west, I'm the beast from the east I am old school like a permanent crease Like Scooby-Doo or a Chuckie doll You better grab a Snickers cause you gonna be here for a while For all the new schoolers, relax and chill As the Diabolical just tell ya the deal Come party With the Biz Markie And ain't no party Without Biz Markie [Verse 2: Biz Markie] Now let me tell you how I started in '92 When I was deejayin in Jersey in Howard Hughes I did homecomings from UVa to James Madison I did the Tunnel with Flex and caught L in Patterson Now I graduated with DJ Love From ( ? ) Virginia, NC and the Q Club People looked at me and said, "Why you deejayin?

Artist:	Canibus & Biz Markie Album:	Office Space soundtrack Song:	Shove This Jay-Oh-Bee Typed by: mamasuga@hmc.edu [Canibus] Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning To the sound of your alarm clock alarming About an hour from now You should be at the place of employment Which is annoying cause it's so boring Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them It affects your occupational performance You wonder why your work load is so enormous Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office People get depressed, they get ulcers From the stress that the corporate environment causes Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this Seems to me like you've got one of four choices: You could take a new job offer for more chips Stick it out a little longer or forfeit But my advice to anybody that wants to quit It'll feel much better if you say it like this: [Biz Markie] Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it [Canibus] Yo, if your boss is a S-O-B Tell him to S-H-O-V-E the J-O-B Put your middle finger up slowly Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely Say I ain't workin here no more Who do you think you are? Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor Run to the door, to the payphone Make a toll-free call Tell your spouse what happened and where you are So they can come and get you in the car later on And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job If the unemployment line ain't that long You can take your time printin out W-9 forms Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough And you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to [Biz Markie] Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it [Canibus] Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs The boss's favorites get placed in something spacious While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated You constantly waitin for a paycheck Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet Here's a optimistic motto If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow Most 9 to 5's are hard  cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park People get hired Drink coffee to stay wired So they don't get tired, sleep late, and get fired [Biz Markie] You came in late, you already ate,  nowww, you wanna take a lunch break!??! [Canibus] Ay, yo bust it, ain't no need to discuss it Just take this job and shove it, right between your buttocks [Biz Markie] Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Ah Ah ah ah ahahah ah I ain't workin here no more Take this job and shove it I ain't workin here no more Ay Ay Ay ayee ay I ain't workin here no more Canibus and the Biz It's comin from Canibus and the Biz It's comin from Canibus and the Biz From, from Canibus and the Biz The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Spin Doctors & Biz Markie Album: Space Jam Soundtrack Song: That's the Way (I Like It) Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com [Note: cover of K.C. & The Sunshine Band's "That's The Way (I Like It)" with changes] [*Biz beatboxes for a couple of seconds before beat begins*] [Biz] Here we go Here we go Oooooooooooooh [Chorus - Biz Markie singing (Spin Doctors)] That's the way, (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it, (uh-huh, uh-huh) That's the way, (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it, (uh-huh, uh-huh) That's the way, (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it, (uh-huh, uh-huh) That's the way, (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it, (uh-huh, uh-huh) [Chris Barron of Spin Doctors] When you take me, by the hand Tell me I'm, your lovin' man, OH!

I blamed it on my mind in an altered state But chillin up north on a reindeer plate Instead of Louis Vuitton or a Gucci vixen His ride had pictures of Donner and Blitzen To top it off he had a phone and tints Instead of threads homes' tires left hook prints He came to halt, but he did not screech And in the back of my mind somethin said, "Don't reach" He said, "Ho, ho, ho... yo Shan," loud and clear "I ain't heard a rap from you in a year Merry Christmas, here's some beats, there's brew and a broth And if you don't rock these, that means you're soft" He said, "Shan my man, I got a busy night And you'll be straight next year if you rock this right" To my surprise when I awoke on Christmas dawn I couldn't find my tapes and my lyrics were gone But underneath the tree in a red and blue pack Was a Cold Chillin'/Warner Bros. contract So I'm here tonight to share my cheers So Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year (Pump it up, pump it up) [ Fly Ty ] Kane be doin it again Wanna do it again, Kane?
