The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Criminal Minded Song: Poetry Verse One: KRS-One Well now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson Class is in session so you can stop guessin If this is a tape or a written down memo See I am a professional, this is not a demo In fact call it a lecture, a visual picture Sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture Listen, I'm not dissin but there's somethin that you're missin Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishin For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste If this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it It takes concentration for fresh communication Observation, that is to see without speaking Take off your coat, take notes, I am teachin a class, or rather school, cause you need schooling I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling This is an introduction to poetry A small dedication to those that might know of me They might know of you and maybe your gang But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang Cause yo I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow Say something now ... thought so You seem to be the type that only understand The annihilation and destruction of the next man That's not poetry, that is insanity It's simply fantasy far from reality Poetry is the language of imagination Poetry is a form of positive creation Difficult, isn't it? The point? You're missin it Your face is in front of my hand so I'm dissin it Verse Two: KRS-One Scott LaRock is innovating, decorating hip-hop The beat may drop but not like all the others They just cover while I just smother Every single stupid mutha -- wait wait brotha KRS-One will have to show another MC or self-proclaimed king or queen Or gang or crew or solo or team That I mean Business So tell me what is this? See I come from the Bronx so just kiss this Boogie Down Productions is somewhat an experiment The antidote for sucka MC's and they're fearin it It's self-explanatory, no one's writin for me The poetry I'm rattlin is really not for battlin But if you want I will simply change the program So when I'm done you will simply say "damn" So this conversation is somewhat hypothetical Boogie Down Productions attempts to prove somethin I say hypothetical because it's only theory My theory, so take a minute now to hear me Verse Three: KRS-One So what's your problem? It seems you want to be KRS-Two From my point of view, backtrack, stop the attack Cos KRS-One means simply one KRS That's it, that's all, solo, single, no more, no less I've built up my credential financially and mental Anytime I rhyme I request the instrumental I speak clearly and that's merely Or should I say a mere, help to my career I'm really not into fashion or craze Just the one who pays and how soon I get a raise You're probably in a daze, acting out of sympathy Wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me But what a pity, I'm rockin New York City And everywhere else, you put the jams on the shelf You as an amateur is outspoken I'm looking at your face, you seem to be hopin That I might stutter, stop, or just mess up But everything's live that's why I don't dress up "Blastmaster KRS" a synonym for "fresh" I'm the teacher of the class, I do not pass no test Got DJ Scott LaRock by my side, not in back of me Cos we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew faculty Get it right, or train yourself not to bite Cos when you bite you have bitten, when I hear it, that's it I do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it I'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it I'm teaching poetry I'm teaching poetry Scott LaRock We're teaching po-e-try The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Criminal Minded Song: South Bronx Scott La Rock: Yo, wassup Blastmaster KRS-ONE. This jam is kickin' KRS: Word! Yo, what-up D-Nice? D-Nice: Yo, wassup Scott La Rock? SLR: Yo man, we chillin' this funky fresh jam. I wanna tell  you a little somethin' about us. We're the Boogie Down  Productions crew and due to the fact that no-one else out there  knew what time it was, we have to tell you a little story about  where we come from... South Bronx, the South South Bronx (4X) Many people tell me this style is terrific It is kinda different but let's get specific KRS-One specialized in music I'll only use this type of style when I choose it Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks Ya got dropped off MCA cause the rhymes you wrote was wack So you think that hip-hop had it's start out in Queensbridge If you popped that junk up in the Bronx you might not live Cause you're in... South Bronx, the South South Bronx (4X) I came with Scott LaRock to express one thing I am a teacher and others are kings If that's a title they earn, well it's well deserved, but without a crown, see, I still burn You settle for a pebble not a stone like a rebel KRS-One is the holder of a boulder, money folder You want a fresh style let me show ya Now way back in the days when hip-hop began With CoQue LaRock, Kool Herc, and then Bam Beat boys ran to the latest jam But when it got shot up they went home and said "Damn There's got to be a better way to hear our music every day Beat boys gettin blown away but comin outside anyway" They tried again outside in Cedar Park Power from a street light made the place dark But yo, they didn't care, they turned it out I know a few understand what I'm talkin about Remember Bronx River rollin thick With Kool DJ Red Alert and Chuck Chillout on the mix When Afrika Islam was rockin the jams And on the other side of town was a kid named Flash Patterson and Millbrook projects Casanova all over, ya couldn't stop it The Nine Lives Crew, the Cypress Boys The real Rock Steady takin out these toys As odd as it looked, as wild as it seemed I didn't hear a peep from a place called Queens It was seventy-six, to 1980 The dreads in Brooklyn was crazy You couldn't bring out your set with no hip-hop Because the pistols would go... So why don't you wise up, show all the people in the place that you are wack Instead of tryna take out LL, you need to take your homeboys off the crack Cos if you don't, well, then their nerves will become shot And that would leave the job up to my own Scott LaRock And he's from...

But he tried to play me out and KRS-One knew it He reached for his pistol but it was just a waste Cos my 9 millimeter was up against his face He pulled his pistol anyway and I filled him full of lead But just before he fell to the ground this is what I said...

They fall down to the floor but one was still alive So I put my 9 millimeter right between his eyes Looked at his potnah and both of them were dead So just before he joined his potnah this is what I said...

Relax, tell me the story" I said "You remember Peter? Well his posse tried to kill me I'm all right now because the sensemi' fill me" Scott just laughed, he said "I know they're all dead And just before you pulled the trigger this is what you said..."

I'm livin in a city known as New York State Sucka MC's gotta wait while I translate I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads People with ambition and straight up musicians Although our lives have been so uprooted I have it included, you all get zooted So take each letter of the KRS-One Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone You look at me and laugh, but this is your class It's an all-out discussion of the suckas I be crushin So now you are awakened to the music I be makin Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated Don't get frustrated cause nothin has been traded Only activated, it came out very complicated Not separated, from my DJ You see my voice is now faded I'll see you folks around the way Criminal minded...

This one or that one, the white one or the black one pick the punk, and I'll jump up to attack one KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew right up to your face and dis you Everyone saw me on the last album cover Holding a pistol something far from a lover Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T I just laughed, cause no one can defeat me This is lecture number two, "My Philosophy" Number one, was "Poetry" you know it's me This is my philosophy, many artists got to learn I'm not flammable, I don't burn so please stop burnin, and learn to earn respect 'cause that's just what KR collects see, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk you walk down the street and get jumped You got to have style, and learn to be original and everybody's gonna wanna diss you like me, we stood up for the South Bronx and every sucka mc had a response You think we care? I know that they are on the tip my posse from the Bronx is thick and we're real live, we walk correctly a lot of suckas would like to forget me  but they can't, cause like a champ I have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second on the mic, I believe that you should get loose I haven't come to tell you I have juice I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level I'll be back, but for now just seckle! [Verse Two] I'll play the nine and you play the target you all know my name so I guess I'll just start it or should I say, "Start this," I am an artist of new concepts at their hardest cause, yo, I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar It ain't about money cause we all make dollars That's why I walk with my head up when I hear wack rhymes I get fed up Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games a lot of suckas with colorful names I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack I'm not white or red or black  I'm brown.. from the Boogie Down Productions, of course our music be thumpin' others say their bad, but they're buggin let me tell you somethin' now about hip hop about D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker some mc's be talkin' and talkin' tryin' to show how black people are walkin but I don't walk this way to portray or reinforce stereotypes of today like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon talk broken english and drug sellin' See I'm tellin, and teaching real facts The way some act in rap is kind of wack and it lacks creativity and intelligence but they don't care cause the company is sellin' it It's my philosophy, on the industry Don't bother dissin me, or even wish that we'd soften, dilute, or commercialize all our lyrics Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it And hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man A vegetarian, no goat or ham or chicken or turkey or hamburger 'cause to me that's suicide self-murder let us get back to what we call hip hop and what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock... [Verse Three] How many mc's must get dissed before somebody says, "Don't f*** with Kris!" this is just one style, out of many Like a piggy bank, this is one penny My brother's name is Kenny - that's, Kenny Parker My other brother I.C.U. is much darker Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers the lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher It's not about a salary it's all about reality Teachers teach and do the world good kings just rule and most are never understood If you were to rule or govern a certain industry All inside this room right now would be in misery No one would get along nor sing a song 'cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?! So yo, what's up, it's me again Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend We're criminal minded, an album which is only ten Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records no more than four minutes and some seconds the competition checks and checks and keeps checkin' they buy the album, take it home, and start sweatin' why? well it's simple, to them it's kind of vital to take KRS-One's title to them I'm like an idol, some type of entity in everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me? or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock but they can get bust get robbed, get dropped I don't play around nor do I f*** around and you can tell by the bodies that are left around when some clown jumps up to get beat down broken down to his very last compound see how it sounds? a little unrational a lot of mc's like to use the word DRAMATICAL! Fresh for '88, you suckas...

A sucka in fear I snatched your heart Put it way up on the chart At ten you're fucked At nine you suck At eight you're a sucker At seven-a mothafucka At six you're slapped At five you're just wacked At four you're lost At three, you're just soft At two you're an ass At one, you're a dick But before you slip, I'll whip Cuz homeboy, ya slippin' (Yo get my slip on, I'm chillin on. A long time, ya see me slip on, crop D, and I'll slip on, everybody-I slip on. Sayin? I'll come back if I miss you, sayin?) I understand that music calms the savage beast But keep in mind that I compose my music piece by piece First a bass, a snare A little cut over there I add my name K-R-S  And the shit becomes fresh I ask Moe and ICU for their thoughts Layin' down a power play all the suckas are tought One again, the tactics of original arts We're gettin' payed to the end cuz we were down from the start We're known as Boogie Down Productions, ain't no B-boy stance Gauranteed to make ya dance, if you give us a chance We're goin' off and of course all ya suckas are lost You wanna hear a fresh rhyme? You've come to the source Because I'm the type of guy who's not put up on a pedestal Run my rhyme on time and on schedule One after another, another to the next Can't rhyme when you're tense, or your muscles won't flex Check your larynx It may get lower havin' sex Or may get higher When bustin' as a liar These are the things I teach so be tought To me you're kinda short, how many battles have you fought? If you come up with a number, notebook, or list It just doesn't matter, you can still get dissed I'm bringin' back that ol' New York rap That gets you jacked while you're hands still clap It's funny Just dissin' you I can make money But noone's tippin' My message is simple: Ya' slippin! (They slippin'-dough-1987-they spippin', but we goin' all the way to the top man (word)-you know what I'm sayin? To my brother KRS-1, you're large, I'm sayin, large-everytime, man, large. They're slippin') E-N-O, S-R-K When you go through other albums, you're sure to say Goddam! They all seem to sound alike Till you hear the crew standin' over in the light Showing, glowing, on the top growing The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing Just like a river, or better yet a stream I'm proud to be down with the winning team So don't ever in your life even think about an arguement Cuz you'll get walked on like carpet We'll pick you up, and dust you off Stamp BDP on you're head and you're off But you won't even change that to say instead I'm down cuz I got a BDP on my head So just before you inherit that ass kicking I suggest you wake right up cuz ya slippin' (Yo! They slippin'-dough, they slippin'-dough, they slippin'-word up, I don't care no more, man, I'm commin' out of the shell-dough, they slippin' man. B-boy Records, Magic, yo all the time they slippin-ya know what I'm saying? This other kid-I don't know what his name is, but you know what time it is. (WORD UP!) He's slippin' too (everybody).

Worldwide! Worldwide! One two three, the crew is called BDP and if you want to go to the tip top stop the violence in hip-hop, Y-O Time and time again, as I pick up the pen as my thoughts emerge, these are those words I glance at the paper to know what's going on someone's doing wrong, the story goes on Mary Lue's had a baby someone else decapitated the drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated I look, but it doesn't coincide with my books social studies when I speak upon political crooks It's just the presidents, and all the money they spent all the things they invent and how the house is so immaculate They paid missiles, my family's eating gristle then they get upset when the press blows the whistle Of course the main profiles are kept low you temper with some jobs, now the press is controlled Not only newspapers, but every single station you only get to hear the president is on vacation But ehrm, stay calm, there's no need for alarm You say "go back" to your mom, and you're off to Vietnam You shoot to kill, come back and you're a veteran but how many veterans are out there pedaling? There's no telling, 'cause they continue selling As quiet as it's kept, I won't go into depth You can talk about Nigeria, people used to laugh at ya. Now I take a look, I say "USA for Africa?!" Huh. What's the solution, to stop all this confusion? Rewrite the constitution, change the drug which you're using Rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation we fight inflation, yet the president's still on vacation BDP posse! I say: one two three, the crew is called BDP And if you wanna go to the tip top stop the violence in the hip-hop, Y-O This might sound a little strange to you well here's the reason I came to you We gotta put our heads together, and stop the violence Cause real bad boys move in silence When you're in a club, you come to chill out not watch someones blood just spill out That's what these other people want to see another race fight endlessly You know we're being watched, you know we're being seen Some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop But I won't drop not I or Scott LaRock Now here is the message that we bring today: hip-hop will surely decay if we as a people don't stand up and say: "Stop the violence!" "Stop the violence!" "Stop the violence!" "Stop the violence!" "Stop the violence!" I say: one two three, the crew is called BDP And if you wanna go to the tip top stop the violence in the hip-hop, Y-O BDP and me we step into the party top celebrity Say when we're coming to dance, we never have to pay a fee Cause that's where we got R-E-S-P-E-C-T I have this one wife, her name is Miss Melody I know I'm from the Bronx, she from the Brooklyn posse I tell ya look a little like this, then I tell you some that I Sometimes I got my gear on, sometimes I wear a hat Sometimes I'm in a Mercedes and sometimes I'm in a plain Sometimes I find myself upon the number two train Some people look at me and see negativity some people look at me and see positivity But when I see myself I see creativity So if I can create, well then I make some money Sha man, just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid Sha man, just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid One two three, the crew is called BDP And if you wanna go to the tip top stop the violence in the hip-hop, Y-O The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: By All Means Necessary Song: Illegal Business Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {*30 seconds in: DJ scratches "What can we get for 63 cents?"*} Cocaine business controls America Ganja business controls America KRS-One come to start some hysteria Illegal business controls America [KRS-One] One afternoon around eleven o'clock It was freezin cold, he was standing on the block Sellin cheeba, nick's and dimes Sayin a rhyme just to pass the time The cops passed by, but he stayed calm Cause the leather trench coat was keepin him warm But this time they walked by real slowly He thought to himself, "They look like they know me" They drove away, but he didn't stay He jumped in the cab and he paid his tab But guess who he saw when he hit the block It was the same cop car, the same two cops They jumped out quick, they pulled a gun They said, "Don't try to fight and don't try to run Cooperate and we will be your friend Non-cooperation will be your end" He jumped in the car, and while they rode they ran down the list of things he owed They said, "You owe us some money, you owe us some product Cause you could be right in the river tied up" He thought for a second and he said, "What is this? You want me to pay you to stay in business?" They said, "That's right, or you go to prison cause nobody out there is really gonna listen to a hood," so he said, "Good!

Red Alert, he's down with us  Robocop boy, he's down with us  Makin' funky music is a must  I'm number one.  People still takin' rappin' for a joke  A passing hope or a phase with a rope  Sometimes I choke and try to believe  when I get challenged by a million MCs  I try to tell them, "We're all in this together!"  My album was raw because no-one would ever  think like I think and do what I do  I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue  What do you think makes up a KRS?  Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?  Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble  Rebel, renegade, must stay paid  not by financial aid, but a raid of hits  causing me to take long trips  I'm the original teacher of this type of style  Rockin' off-beat with a smile  or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to  BDP Posse so I love to  step in the jam and slam  I'm not Superman, because anybody can  or should be able to rock off turntables  Grab the mic, plug it in and begin  But here's where the problem starts, no heart  Because of that a lot of groups fell apart  Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School  cuz Rap is still a brand-new tool  I say no-one's from the Old School cuz Rap on a whole  isn't even twenty years old  Fifty years down the line, you can start this  cuz we'll be the Old School artists  And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme  A brand-new style, ruthless and wild  Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun  cuz even then, I'm still number one.  Verse 2  Blastmaster KRS-One of course  comes to express with style the lost  ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present  Knock, knock, who is it?  A brand-new style, hup, time to change  People talk about me when they see me on stage  Live in action, guaranteed raw  I hang with the rich and I work for the poor  Now tomorrow you can say you saw  KRS-One stompin' once more  I play by ear, I love to steer  the Alfa Romeo from here to there  I grab the beer, but not in the ride  cuz I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive  I'm not a beginner, amateur or local  My album is sellin' because of my vocals  You know what you need to learn?  Old School artists don't always burn  You're just another rapper who's had his turn  Now it's my turn, and I am concerned  about idiots posing as kings  What are we here to rule?  I thought we were supposed to sing  And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach  Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak  KRS-One is something like a total renegade  except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid  Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'  Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'  not to escape, but hit the problem head-on  by bringin' out the truth in a song  So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions  made a little noise cuz the crew was sayin' somethin'  People have the nerve to take me for a gangster  An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster  Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary  But in a scale of crime that's really elementary  This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence  why my last jam was so violent  It's simple: BDP will teach reality  No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free  So now you know, a poet's job is never done  But I'm never overworked, cuz I'm still number one.  Kool Moe Dee, he's down with us  Eric B. and Rakim, they're down with us  Stetsasonic, they're down with us  Dana Dane, he's down with us  Sleeping Bag Records, they're down with us  My lawyer Jay, he's down with us  Jive/RCA is down with us  Makin' funky music is a must  I'm number one.

I can, anytime, on the spot rhyme Many recording artists can't do it, but I'm More than just a recording artist kicking dust (who?) I'm a sandstorm, taking human form K plus R S equals one I don't burn anymore, I just cook 'till you're done And when you're done, then I serve Like alphabet soup, (letters) letters, (words) words Sentences, chunks of meat into a paragraph Get the meaning then ask the question 'bout the guy Who first is down but then he lies What he is to you, he's a part time sucker Kewe-kewe-K, Arewa-arewa-R, Ewe-ewe-S, my rhymes are fresh Please step back, let me progress Meaning to advance, you only get a glance Of me at a time, sayin' some rhyme Or sayin' some rekkid, that should respect it, select it I'm never ever wack or reject it Challenge BDP it get's dissed, expect it I travel the nation by mostly plane I travel New York by either cab or the train Some say that I'm insane, they say Why would you want to ride the train (But I) but I don't care, as long as I get there I never used to pay my fare, but now I think I got to Because from a jail cell I can't rock you That's being incarcerated, meaning locked up (A tool) a tool for holding water is a cup or pail, The opposite for fresh is stale (The largest) the largest sea-mammal is a whale Beer is called ale, or sometimes it is called brew (A group a) a group of human beings is a crew You know what I'm gonna do?

Verse 1  Many have claimed to attain levels in rhymin'  But when I listen to 'em I see they're only lyin'  They're tryin', but after some years if you ain't got it  Lay it down, put it down, find a way to try and stop it  Or change it, rearrange it, be a producer  Don't touch the microphone because you'll always be the loser  And laughed at, smirked on, you don't belong  With those that perform their song on and on  And on and on and on, yo, let's get specific  This style is for the gifted, poetically uplifted  I speak to you, not at you to attack you  Maybe when I'm through with this rhyme I'll get a statue  So now I ax you or tell you people literally  When it comes to rockin' funky lyrics few are better than me  Down with BDP, endlessly recitin' poetry  Any time I'm in the street, you hear my voice, you know it's me  KR...nope!

Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash Verse One The day begins, with a grin And a prayer to excuse my sins I can walk anywhere I choose Cause everybody listens to the B.D.P. crew We're not here for glamour or fashion But here's the question I'm askin Why is it young black kids taught {flashin?} They're only taught how to read, write, and act It's like teachin a dog to be a cat You don't teach white kids to be black Why is that? Is it because we're the minority? Well black kids follow me Genesis chapter eleven verse ten Explains the geneology of Chem Chem was a black man, in Africa If you repeat this fact they can't laugh at ya Genesis fourteen verse thirteen Abraham steps on the scene Being a descendent of Chem which is a fact Means, Abraham too was black Abraham born in the city of a black man Called Nimrod grandson of Kam Kam had four sons, one was named Canaan Here, let me do some explaining Abraham was the father of Isaac Isaac was the father of Jacob Jacob had twelve sons, for real And these, were the children of Isreal According to Genesis chapter ten Egyptains descended from {Hahm,Kam} Six hundred years later, my brother, read up Moses was born in Egypt In this era black Egyptians weren't right They enslaved black Isrealites Moses had to be of the black race Because he spent fourty years in Pharoah's place He passed as the Pharoah's grandson So he had to look just like him Yes my brothers and sisters take this here song Yo, correct the wrong The information we get today is just wack But ask yourself, why is that? Verse Two The age of the ignorant rapper is done Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone The stereotype must be lost That love and peace and knowledge is soft Do away with that and understand one fact For love, peace must attack And attack real strong, stronger than war To conquer it and its law Mental pictures, stereotypes and fake history Reinforces mystery And when mystery is reinforced That only means that knowledge has been lost When you know who you really are Peace and knowledge shines like a star I'm only showin you a simple fact It Takes A Nation of MILLIONS to Hold Us people Back Which is wack, but we can correct that Teach and learn what it is to be black Cause they're teachin birds to be a cat But ask yourself homeboy, why is that?

This is another public service announcement You can believe it, or you can doubt it Let us begin now with the cow The way it gets to your plate and how The cow doesn't grow fast enough for man So through his greed he makes a faster plan He has drugs to make the cow grow quicker Through the stress the cow gets sicker Twenty-one different drugs are pumped Into the cow in one big lump So just before it dies, it cries In the slaughterhouse full of germs and flies Off with the head, they pack it, drain it, and cart it And there it is, in your local supermarket Red and bloody, a corpse, neatly packed And you wonder about heart attacks? Come on now man let's be for real You are what you eat is the way I feel But, the Food and Drug Administration Will tell you meat is the perfect combination See cows live under fear and stress Trying to think what's gonna happen next Fear and stress can become a part of you In your cells and blood, this is true So when the cow is killed, believe it You preserve those cells, you freeze it Thaw it out with the blood and season it Then you sit down and begin eatin it In your body, it's structure becomes your structure All the fear and stress of another Any drug is addictive by any name Even drugs in meat, they are the same The FDA has America strung out On drugs in beef no doubt So if you think that what I say is a bunch of crock Tell yourself you're gonna try and stop Eatin meat and you'll see you can't compete It's the number one drug on the street Not crack, cause that was made for just black But brown beef, for all American teeth Life brings life and death brings death Keep on eatin the dead and what's left Absolute disease and negative Read the book 'How to Eat to Live' By Elijah Muhammad, it's a brown paperback For anybody, either white or black See how many cows must be pumped up fatter How many rats gotta fall in the batter How many chickens that eat shit you eat How much high blood pressure you get from pig feet See you'll consume, the FDA could care less They'll sell you donkey meat and say it's FRESH!

All I see, is the light-skinned buffy Tryin hard, to be Mr. Tuffy Yet in fact, you're Mr. Softie with the beige contacts on, yo you lost me I ain't with it, never will, never have How can your son even call you dad? Your skin is bleached and your nails you just buffin Take a look at yourself man, YA STRUGGLIN' [Kwame Toure'] Africa is so strong, that once she puts a stamp on you four hundred years of cold weather, death, and all that fryin your hair shall not disguise you As a matter of fact, she is so strong that no matter what chemicals you put in your hair she will come back and snatch it up  * audience laughter * [KRS-One] Tell me Are you proud man, of who you are? Or does your pride come out of a jar Cause if you bought it, put it on, or sprayed it on I tell you right now, it won't stay long Cause if it ain't natural, it ain't kosher It's like buyin and wearin a culture If that culture ain't yours naturally it's his, not yours, actually You better wake up and smell the coffee Look in the mirror and think Mr. Softie People change, when they are ashamed of how they look or from which they came Are you ashamed, of original black? If you're not, why does your hair look like that? Why is your nose straighter, from surgery? I think you're really in a state of emergency You're not sane to the African aim so you're insane, and you need to obtain ANY, average rap album sculpture and study it, JUST, to learn your culture Even though, you don't think it's music It's the blackest you'll EVER get so use it The blue-eyed black man to me is buggin Take a look at yourself man, YA STRUGGLIN' [Kwame Toure'] * audience laughter * Yess.. capitalism will confuse these people, have them totally confused They will try every way to identify with their masters, every way Go to extreme lengths * laughter *, I'm telling you, seriously! Capitalism will confuse them y'know tell them the truth's a lie I saw a sister the other day and I spoke to her about her hair she said, "I don't care what you say, I'm still gonna get my perm!"

Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Edutainment Song: Exhibit D Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [KRS-One] All you white people out there that think you're down with America can forget it. Cause they TAX all of us. All of us, one by one. Just take a look at Leona Helm-Helmsley. Taxed her, she's white I believe. *laughter* Yeah threw her butt right in jail. She ain't nothin but another hoe, according to this system. *laughter* You ain't pay your taxes hoe, get back in jail. *uproarious laughter* The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Edutainment Song: Edutainment Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [KRS-One] Give it to em! Nuff respect! And praise to the creator Over the years it seems that I became a landmark, in the hip-hop field of art I shed light, yet my skin is dark I'm not conerned with climbin the chart Cause why should you pay when it comes from the heart? I'll start, cause only Jah will create it I'll just name it, Edutainment People sit and they look at my album like a problem, they try to solve em They don't know, it only leads the way to a bright more positive day By itself, it's NOT the bright day Sit up straight, and hear what I say Fear and ignorance, I'm down for stoppin this but the bright day is your conciousness I am poet, my words will heal you I'm not a phony I'll really feel you That's why I walk and talk to my nation Wherever they are, in any situation They usually ask for an autograph And I'll whip out the pen and just write Blast- -Master, K-R-S, O-N-E BDP, Peace and Unity But do not concentrate on the paper Concentrate on the laws of the creator Cause when the paper's gone, it will deceive you But Allah will never leave you Nothing I say now is hypothetical These are the facts, a little metaphysical We are one, every heart every lung So why then was the black man hung? He was hung by the so-called Christians that went to church, and did not listen See Jesus couldn't stand politics so they nailed him to a crucifix Then it was that way, today it's a trigger So why is the Pope such a political figure? I don't know, but it's really beyond me But through knowledge, they'll NEVER con me Cause from Jesus Christ to right now everytime a black man speaks up, KA-POW See people concentrate on the leader And not the message comin through the speaker If the Christians really heard Christ the black man never would've lived this life My point is that do not concentrate on what I state, create, or debate I might be great, and you might admire But what I say is to take you MUCH higher MORE higher than the physical plane to the plane of forces in the astral plane The mental plane, and the final three They're all around you, yet you can't see So grab the sphere of life and aim it and you'll be guided by Edutainment The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Edutainment Song: Homeless Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash Yeah... You could call a man a bum with disgust on your morning run Cause he lives outside in the street, you don't know this But you've failed to realise that the one you so despise Reflects yourself cos every black man is homeless You could take your Alka-Seltzer while you talk about shelter You might even wanna talk about a little loan Cause no matter how rich you become you'll always be two, not one Cause believe it or not, America ain't your home We've been taught to say our name, Afro-American, all the same Not fully American but gettin' there very slowly Cause to fully be American, you know, you gotta take out the word 'Afro' Now they've relaxed I hear they might as well call us Toby See, Afro and black are African, while theft is American So how can Afro-American make much sense? Your ancestors come from Africa By stealing them now you're born in America So the black man is homeless even though he pays rent Some black people say "We built this place So we are American, but of the black race" Well let me make this little topic known The Japanese also built this place In technology and they're winnin' the race But at the end of the day the Japanese can go home Do you see the point that I'm getting at? I'm not a racist, I'm statin' a fact Blacks are actually prisoners of war Cause while South Africa continues to fight We try our best to look more and more white Proof that the blacks have been stripped of their core Well, I guess I didn't sing and dance enough For black radio to play this stuff But this ain't soft like ice-cream with a sugar cone I'm only here to state one fact Wake up African, your colour is black And every black man is homeless cause he ain't got no home Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Edutainment Song: Exhibit E Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [KRS-One] Lincoln said, in this piece here, he says... he frees the slaves; he said, "All slaves in armed rebellion." The slaves. Now understand one point: the African is not a slave, that's one point that they didn't realize when they were writin this. The African is not a slave. The African has a history far more advanced than this nineteen-ninety history we're in right now. He's not a slave. Lincoln's ultimately sayin now you were born a slave, you'll always be a slave, and all I will ever see you as is a slave, and I free you.

And just back up quickly Your style is sickly, but you persist to get me or outwit me with the style that I created years ago when you was doin a dollar fifty show Oh, all of a sudden you don't know or can't remember, can't recall, can't bring to mind that rhyme that place do not chase I run a marathon a race of rhymes in your face In case you bass I'll erase your whole rap Tell you right now I ain't TRYIN to hear that I don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo I only grab the mic and bust holes in a crew I deny your existence as artists You're puttin out a record expectin to chart but it's weak, but when you speak through the microphone You fail to realize nope you're not alone on the earth, the light comes forth as KRS Intelligence, force, and love manifest in the flesh I snatch the mic and shed light Behave, you're still a 20th century slave Headed for the grave in a wave So save the microscopic miniature small talk and walk and put a little pep in your step KRS-One will destroy any ignorant reputation in the nation, in creation Princes, Kings, Queens, or any occupation Like rappers with nuttin to say I crush those idiots and throw em away Cause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather gather together and splatter whatever egotistic mystics, with macho poses If you ain't for black you're down for Guns 'n' Roses Yeah! C'mon! Throw your hands in the sky And wave em from side to side And if you're in this life just gettin by Somebody say, ALRIGHT! (ALRIGHT!) ALRIGHT! (ALRIGHT!)

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Edutainment Song: The Racist Typed by: OHHLA.com  Verse  I've been taught to respect my elders and behave  Even if when they were young they sold slaves  Truth and understandin' is what I crave  In the land of the thief, home of the slave  Turn your page to a brief demonstration  Cos now in '90 it's strictly information I'm givin'  Teachin' on a regular basis  Today's lecture is about The Racist  We're not out to exaggerate or diss him  But show the symptoms and facts of racism  Understand The Racist ain't equal  There's about five different types of racist people  First of the five different types of cases  Is the individual brought up racist  Here you have young men and women  Brought up in the Great White Way opinion  This opinion introduced by the parent  To the civilised becomes transparent  The civilised man could look through the faces  Make the analysis and see The Racist  Number two case which y'all must hear  Is the individual racist out of fear  Here you have people that fear the African  And conjure up new ways of trappin' him  Number three is the unconscious racist  Not knowin' they're racist they invade your spaces  They say, "I'm not a racist, I'm not a bigot"  Yet they allow it to go on and won't admit it  Number four is the money racist  The one that used the topics of sheer economics  They say, "Owning a business isn't for the black man  He don't want that", yet they went and took his land  Damn, that's like a rock in a hard place  You don't have your land yet this ain't your space  America was built by every other race  Except the European that runs this place  What a waste, America's doomed  To be overthrown by the righteous real soon  But last but not least racial prejudice  Is the black man speakin' out of ignorance  Whitey this and Ching-Chow that  Is not how the intelligent man acts  You can't blame the whole white race  For slavery, cos this ain't the case  A large sum of white people died with black  Tryin' hard to fight racial attacks  The media wants you to think that no whites  Really fought and died for Civil Rights  But once we have a true sense of history  You'll see this too as a mystery  If black and white didn't argue the most  They could clearly see the government's screwin' 'em both.

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Sex And Violence Song: Drug Dealer Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash All over the world... Chorus: Black drug dealer, you have to wise up And organize your business so that we can rise up If your gonna sell crack then don't be a fool Organize your money and open up a school Verse One:  Drug dealer, understand historical fact Every race got ahead from sellin drugs except Black We are under attack, here comes another cold fact In the 30's and 40's a drug dealer wasn't black They were Jewish, Italian, Irish, Polish, etc. etc. Now in 90 their live's a lot better They'll sell you a sweater, a pair of pants cold hearted But first sellin drugs and killin people is how they started Drug dealer, black and Hispanic, stop killin one another Cause in the ghetto we're all brothers Organized economically, understand the psychology America is the drug monopoly They own the block and kill your brother for Therefore, we got the same enemy - what's more, I go on tour But who do you think picks up the bill? A hard workin fireman? Chill Repeat Chorus 2X Verse Two:  Eighty percent of American business is created illegally This is a fact I don't ask you to believe in me If you're really in the drug game to win it Eventually you're gonna get shot, open a clinic Again, if you're really in the drug game to win it Invest in a prison, therefore you can be put in it Everyone else did it now they chillin Above the law, while your under the law still killin One another, wake up my Hispanic brother, my African brother America's not your mother Or your father, so don't bother with right or wrong Just check out the logic in the song Organize, realize, become unhypnotized To the lies that your livin for the get high See many people have forgotten the fact That America was never ever built for Black So when some people are gonna run and buy crack Take the money and put it back into Black It's only logic, see KRS-One will rock it With knowledge, education for the people Ill never stop it Organize and legitimize your business Remember, everybody else did this Repeat Chorus 2X The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Boogie Down Productions Album: Sex and Violence Song: Like a Throttle Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [KRS-One] *snapping fingers and singing* Ha ha, hah hah! Da-doo-doo-doo, do-doo You wanna test me are you stupid? Gotta be out of your FUCKIN mind KRS-One is the DON, seen? Come down Kenny Park-ah!! Hahaha, you know I don't know what your management be tellin you I don't know what your producers be tellin you But yo, you step this way You're gettin PLAYED, out of position So let me give you a little style Check it out Everytime KRS-One steps in the jam The party is packed, he got the mic in his hand Brooklyn's ready Uptown's in the house Kenny drops the beat and we turn the party out That's it! None of the gimmicks, tricks, oh it's you either have the hits, or the crazy hype lyrics But MC's come half-assed, and lookin pitiful None of em lyrical but their ego is critical Like I said I'm not a Muslim but to Allah I'm obedient Some MC's on the mic become Muslims when it's CONVENIENT And I've seen it! Real Muslims praise Allah, and they mean it Others are dreamin it with Sex Me and Do Me and I'd rather listen to the Brand Nubians You know it's funny everybody wants money And material things from cars and chicken wings When they sing, they sing for the cash They fail to realize, respect will outlast cash You get respect by bein creative and yes a native to your audience, so you know reality In other words, if you ain't a gangsta why play you a gangsta? If you ain't a hoe, why sell sex? If you believe in Allah, how is it you can only work when there's a check? All of this is incorrect First should always come respect The charts are not equal to the respect of the people Their respect doesn't weeble or wobble They know the difference from an artist and a lip-syncin model Right on stage, you'll get a bottle You're-holding-my-dick-like-a-throttle I'm the freshest thing on the mic don't mess with me I'm fresher than your grandmother's fried chicken recipe don't test me, you ain't a chemist and I sure ain't chemistry You're not a mathematician and my name ain't geometry You're no astronomer why see me as astronomy But I'm a Parker so I'll play you like Monopoly Don't entertain the thought of droppin me To think of me as anything less than your teacher Crazy you got to be These type of lyrical styles cannot be said sloppily I rip it up constantly You're-holding-my-dick-like-a-throttle The teacher will come, again and again and again and again To set the trend and lend to other men a perfect blend So-when-their-lyrics-finish-KRS-One-just-begin RIPPING up sucker teachers put their courage to an end So once again, the trendsetter comes a lot better Forever too clever for a petty MC in leather Whenever they decide, whatever I'm in sync The lyrics I write, help me think to guide ink off the paper through the air smack in your face And erase in haste the rhymes you embrace Just in case, get the FUCK out my face I run this place You're lucky you're from the same race A simple technique will keep you on beat With the style from the street you compete with the elite that's WEAK -- flashin gold and can't speak I seek the direction of the brown complexion So every year, I appear somewhere that you hear my dear to get one thing clear Whether on welfare or millionaire Don't step to this here or you outta here Allow me now to please change the gear ?And-pick-up-the-mic-you-missed-those-happen-around-me-have-me-feared, come!? ?We come in the dance we haffa likka of a shot an towah? Let's get back to the hip-hop You come into the place you can't LOOK in my face Cause the light is bright and I'm towering in height See there are millions of stars in the sky When the sun appears none are visible to the eye Why, the reason is the sun is the sun You can't possibly rock, until I'm done and finished, and like the evening I'll fade But when I return you'll cry for more shade So check the dancestyle cause I am not Softening up it's time that I rock and sing Not about my ding-a-ling-a-ling!

[KRS-One] Now technically speakin I ain't 'sposed to be doin this Like givin information to the ones that are new to this You wanna make a record and get into the business? Here's a little plan from a six-year witness First you gotta understand the music game It's not about fame, it's about a rich name and who you're down with, and who you clown with But most of all, you got to have a gift ("it's like that") Either music or the fresh lyrics or a vibe; people like to buy your spirit Everybody knows KRS-One is dope To really see it, you gotta use a telescope, hah! There's no hope when you're shoppin for a deal Either sex appeal, or the hard street feel But if you don't have a lawyer you're a GONER Don't even think about chillin in a sauna You need a lawyer, and a good manager Without this, the record companies won't be havin ya So I'm grabbin ya now and showin ya how not to get jerked when you do hard work! "It's like that y'all" *16X* "One, two, three, WHOO!" [KRS-One] Yo, there's more to it, but let's get through it Many MC's reached the top and then BLEW it You say, "I knew it, that last jam was wack" Either you're strung out on crack, or you don't wanna be black anymore, or, you don't wanna rap anymore or, you do a wack tour, or, you get in trouble with the law or, your fans you ignore, or, you get punched in the jaw cause, you're not hardcore! What makes a jam isn't luck or fate It's writin the jams that the people can relate to Or else they'll HATE you The public will mark you down as a fake crew You don't need allathat Just rap from the heart and you'll have a good start But a lot of MC's want girls and wanna live on top of the world In the jam they wanna flirt Here's how not to get jerked when you do hard work! "It's like that y'all" *16X* [KRS-One] Now understand, rap is rebellious music Therefore, only the rebel should use it But pop artists abuse it When the audience hears real rap, they boo it See rap music is a culture And everyone outside that culture is a vulture The vulture makes money on the culture Understand, I ain't tryin to insult ya But you're either usin rap like the devil or you're pushin rap to another level So don't wait for your company's promotions staff Promote yourself with your own cash! But this might mean you can't buy gold You might have to put that on hold Cause if the artist falls, they diss him! But if the company falls, the artist falls with them! This ain't about a tight skirt Here's how not to get jerked when you do hard work!

Wimps, sitting behind a desk You only get a glimpse of the action or reaction when you don't respond to them TAXING You fuck a lot when you're tax exempt Like with the church, the rules were somehow bent The more money you make, the more money you can have You lose your mind after a while trying to just grab and grab and grab and grab and grab until the pimps roll around real mad, what they say?

You work all week, and now your money has to go to a pimp, and it's you that limp They cut your check and take a tenth Don't wanna hear no lip, about support of family Cause on a piece of paper that's a fantasy They don't care if you're in a bad mood Your wife needs shoes, your kids need food Uh-uh, pick up that money honey The pimps so serious they're funny!

But never the less I was in love with the microphone And it stayed that way until I left home On the streets of New York, now I'm free But with freedom comes big responsibility I used to walk around driven by the force I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off I used to wonder about crews that used to rock They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top Do you ever think about when you outta here? Record deal and video outta here? Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here? No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out! Verse Two: After livin' on the streets alone Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home I used to watch the show "I Dream of Jeannie" And dreamt about "When will I be large like Whodini?" But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday I knew it had to bea better way see So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone Still dreamin' about the microphone Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock And we both loved hip-hop I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em But all along, my vision was never lost I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off Do you ever think about when you're outta here? Fly girl and fresh gear outta here? Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here? No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out! Verse Three: While I'm battling these rival crews Yes, BDP would stay in the street news Some said all they wanna do is battle They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop It used to irk me when these critics had opinions Scott would say "Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'" We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded We told the critics your opinions are bull Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be But right then hip-hop changed drastically People didn't wanna hear the old rap sound We started samplin' beats by James Brown In the middle of doin' My Philosophy Scott was killed and that shit got to me But knowin' the laws of life and death I knew his breath, was one with my breath I had nothin' left and it was scary So I dropped By All Means Necessary Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back These two albums set off consciousness in rap But all along, I'm still lookin' around And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down Do you ever think about when you outta here? Condominium and beach house outta here? Credit cards and bank accounts outta here? No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!

Yeah, officer from overseer You need a little clarity? Check the similarity! The overseer rode around the plantation The officer is off patroling all the nation The overseer could stop you what you're doing The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing The overseer had the right to get ill And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill The officer has the right to arrest And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest! (Woop!) They both ride horses After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices! The police them have a little gun So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one (Woop-woop!)

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: KRS-One Album: Return of the Boom Bap Song: Higher Level Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash Verse One: After seven years of rockin' How do you rate me? Poorly or greatly? Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately Yo mad heads be needin' money So listen very close as I conduct this little study See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV And give up your life trying to be all you can be In the Army Not knowin' your history You either fight and die or come back home in misery Yo get with me, I deal with reality Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me No politican can give you peace If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast? Emancipation is long over due So overcome procrastination Because freedom is within you For some reason we think we're free So we'll never be Because we haven't recognized slavery You're still a slave, look at how you behave Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning? We accepted our opressor's religion So in the case of slavery it ain't hard Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God Where is our God, the God that represents us? The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust? A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria I don't want a God that blesses America I could never really vote for the devil Let me take you to a higher level... Verse Two: Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and Kissing me I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke I like to ask these politicans would Jesus vote? The way we view God is a freakin' shame Church is to blame We trust God, but bomb Hussein We simply lovin' the scripture Same scripture that whipped 'cha Sooner it'll hit 'cha Religion's gettin' richer With that European version of Christ made into a picture Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker... Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated Not to the true God, but the one the government created The same governments tellin' people to vote I pray to God because the people have lost hope You either vote for the mumps or the measels Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil Politics and God are not equal But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal People have more respect for a holy book Than they do for a cow on a meat hook Belivers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils I pray to you for the light you might give them Mother make them know that you're livin' with them You begin them and end them in silence Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican Have mercy Mother, cause I know that you're mad at them The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago And Pope Julius the Second paid Michaelangelo I know this happened in 1519 yet This is the image we can't seem to forget Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil Let me take you to a higher level...

I'm thinkin' real hard about some money I can hold  But everybody I know is deep in the hole  A steady payin' job is too hard for me to hold  I call around for work but they puttin' me on hold  But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold  I make a mayonnaise sandwich out of some whole-  Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold  I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole  Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold  At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole  That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold  I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...  Verse 2  Yeah....yeah.....  Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold  Suddenly I bump into some asshole  He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold  Took control, and in his head I put a hole  Ahhh man, now I'm lookin' around the whole  Area, the gun is still hot that I hold  I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold  I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole  So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole  And felt for the wallet, and took the whole  Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold  Suddenly I hear, "Freeze! Police! Hold!"  Verse 3  Yeah....mmmmm.....  Come on!  Yeah....wooh!  Come on...

My shoe's got a hole  But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?"  He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold  The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole  In me, but then I put him in a chokehold  Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole  Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold  Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole  I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold  My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole.  Damn. Just wasn't satisfied with life.  Yeah....uh!  Yeah....  Check!  The moral to the story is...your addiction to your needs and your  wants is what causes problems in your life. Make sure you got whatcha  need. Put at a safe distance all the things that you want. It's wants  that get you into trouble.  This is the balance of life...the balance to life on a whole.

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: KRS-One Album: KRS-One Song: The Truth Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash   It's not natural    If it goes against God   It's not factual    Her truth is not hard   It's not natural    If it goes against God   It's not factual    Gimme the truth! Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin One of the first things we gotta switch around of course Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery Now seperate Jesus from the cross so you can see The truth about the cross, and the cross's history The cross was created by the Roman government It's only purpose and use, is cap-i-tal punishment But Jesus Christ, was all about the revolution While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect We'd all have little gold guns around our neck If Jesus Christ was killed in electic chair, now get it You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using   It's not natural    If it goes against God   It's not factual    Her truth is not hard   It's not natural    If it goes against God   It's not factual    Gimme the truth! So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision God is not down with religion Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent Reading of the bible is irrelevant You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture If you sit and believe, you can acheive If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct or incorrect, take for instance Adam and Eve The first two people on the planet, or so you believe Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel Huh, now let me show you why the story's unstable According to the story, according to what you believe There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve on the whole planet, now use your intellect and tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex? Upon the whole planet there was not another Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other? Hold up! I thought the church wasn't into that But wait, still yet, there is another fact How did the world get populated? Now tell me if I'm wrong, but obviously Eve had it goin on Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious But yo G, check out the chorus   It's not natural    If it goes against God   It's not factual    Her truth is not hard   It's not natural    If it goes against God   It's not factual    Gimme the truth!

Some of us guess while others of us are blessed Take heed to the word, that I manifest I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass What they tellin me, but yo, you a friend to me so I'ma tell you the secrets of MC longevity Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done And about your career, huh, well choose another one If you don't like what you do, you're through Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny but MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin money That's to say learn other things beside music Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it Too many MC's, just emcee so their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom at the record company Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record Image is respected, records come and go and get collected Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion has me thinkin, the minute they drop a record they'll be cruisin, in the Acura Slow down! You're still a amateur What seperates the pro from the amateur is stamina Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin changin with the times, and findin yourself still CLIIIIIIIIIIIIMbin for wealth Blow for blow, you're still growin, still showin (all knowin) now that's a pro at it Me nah gon' need nuttin else but health, wealth, and knowledge of myself Me nah gon' need nuttin else but health, wealth, and knowledge of myself Thank you Mother, I'm out The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: KRS-One Album: I Got Next Song: 1st Quarter - The Commentary Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash Welcome to hip-hop culture Where DJ-ing, MC-ing, graffiti art, breaking and the philosophies are expressed everyday within the inner cities of America, and the world You are not doing hip-hop You ARE hip-hop Love yourself and your expression, you can't go wrong The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: KRS-One Album: I Got Next Song: 2nd Quarter - Free Throws Typed by: OHHLA.com anybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on and put em on record, I'll give you a second I want to add authenticity to your tape so when it's sold out in the street you all can know this was a real party These are poems circulating throughout the nation everybody's bad and everybody's tough but how many people are intelligent enough to open up their eyes and see through the lies discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive? not many That's why the universe sent me today on this stage with this to to say the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer and in the final hour many heads will lose power what does the rich versus the poor really mean? psychologically it means you got to pick your team when someone says the rich gets richer visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture the rich get richer, cause they work towards rich the poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto let go, it's not a novelty you could love your neighborhood without loving poverty follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter there's no reason to fear the New World Order we must order the whole new world to pay us the New World Order and the old state chaos the Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society but first you and I got to unify stop the negativity and control our creativity the rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer? could it be we still thinking like niggas? educate yourselves, make your world view bigger visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!

("Open up! It's the D.E.A.!") Aww man, just when I went for more lead The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead ("Get down! Get on the floor!") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead But I woke up instead in a cell layin on my bed I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down One was whistlin a love song, as he put some gloves on I thought to myself, damn something's wrong Boom bap!

("Hey wake up kid, you're dreamin!") I said, "Yo dreamin?! That nightmare was hell" But as I look around, I was still in my cell Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?! I wiped the saliva, off my mouth The D.T. said.. ("Let's make a deal") No doubt! No question, now we started up the session No need for guessin, yes they want my supplier I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher? He said.. ("Don't be a God damned liar!") You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty Now the whole investigation is federal We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal He continued to say, you can't think it through This whole drug game is BIGGER than you! Follow our plan man and you'll be free Let me explain one thing so you can see, we [KRS-One] Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up Constantly thinkin about bein tied up Snap out of it - I'm thinkin, "Damn we like elves! The federal and local cops got wars with themselves; and I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle. My nose is runny.." {*knock at door*} ("Let me get a 20!") A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown? ("Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!") {*gunfire*} God damn, God damn, here we go again But this time I'm set up by my federal friend Suddenly I hear.. ("Yo, move from the door!") {*two shots*} Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four {*two shots*} After the violence, then there was silence Then I heard.. ("Hey yo it's us, open up the door!") But rule number one in this game is self-reliance So I pickd up the mini-mac in case they wanted more The door opened up, the feds said WHATTUP? They was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked Suddenly a sense of trust came over me I thought to myself, "Well soon I'll be free!"

If you don't repeat the actions of your own success you won't be successful You gotta know your own formula, your own ingredients What made you, YOU.. 1987 I was at the Latin Quarters Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order The call of the order was to avoid the slaughter He said, "Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!" Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing And that was great, so in 1988 there was no debate, we had to end the hate The name of the game was "Stop the Violence" and unity, knowledge, and self-reliance We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm Had these ghetto kids goin, "Huh, what about him?" 1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind but his freedom of speech is declined 1990 came with the West coast East coast, West coast, who is the best coast? Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus The whole argument was where we lost focus We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music but with hip-hop, and how we used it Or abused it, you know how the crew get "You like it cause you choose it" 1991, we opened our eyes with Human Education Against Lies, we tried to talk about the state of humanity But all these others rappers got mad at me They called me "Captain Human", another message was sent "Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent" Remember that? Nobody wanted conscious rap It was like - where these ballers at? Where can they call us at? All was wack Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that So in 1992, I found my crew They said, "Yo Kris, what you wanna do?" I said, "Damn - why they wanna get with me? If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory. If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe. Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?" So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it "Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry" Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me {Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen So I go back to the philosopher 1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack Go back, check the facts 1994, "Return of the Boom Bap" It wasn't all about the loot It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute Blowin up, 1995 Conscious rap is still alive But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it 1996 it really don't stop We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics But how hip-hop affects the spirit "Step Into a World," that's what I did 1997 I was raisin my kid or kids, but I, had to go Cause New York DJ's changed the flows to clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV So in 1998 I began to debate Should I go now, or should I really wait? '99, I moved to L.A. you see and took a gig with the WB Started studyin philosophy full-time To have a full heart, full body, full mind But you know what the problem is or was? DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz they so caught up in the cash and jewels How they gonna really see a hip-hop school? How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple? They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute Mic Conception, all of them, said "Yo you need help? I should call them" When I was in L.A., I held the crown Bloods, Crips, they held me down I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride with the gat in the lap in the low-ride Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou Julio G, that was the crew Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor The list goes on and on, let me tell ya FredWreck, and my man Protest Much respect, no less To my spiritual and mental defenders Big up to L.A., temple members But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live I wasn't no executive So I picked up the mic and I quit my job Said to Simone I gotta get with God She said, "Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters. Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya." Damn, she took me back to Bam! Took me back to who I am! Brought me back to the New York land! Now I overstand!.. {interviewer} Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live. {KRS} Yes! {interviewer} Explain that to us please. {KRS-One} Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not, just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way to view the world. So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP, is something we live. And we look at hip-hop, in it's 9 elements; which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing, street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street  entrepenurialism - trade and business. And uhh, that's where y'know that's the hip-hop that that that we're about. We come from the uhh the root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's and then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm) who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons and added conciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash with the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself. And uhh, we created the "Stop the Violence" movement, you may recall a song, "Self Destruction" and and and so on. All of this, goes to uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility for how it looks and and acts in society.

Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin I mean rockin it live, not pickin his cotton I mean adjustin his clothes, I mean how do you know Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated That you're not gettin cheated That you ain't come to the club thinkin 'I must've been weeded!' (Word) You got to be a educated consumer Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya Ass they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas in a flick When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter He pulls his gat while we bust off the gatler [ CHORUS ] This is the "Sneak Attack" The "Edutainment" style returns like that Take it off your shelf Cause all we deal with is knowledge of self, health and wealth Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers Original hip-hop armor on cd-rom - eh You got to get with a 21st century philosopher Representin the religion of hip-hop, sir Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - eh Stopped, eh - I rise like a helicopter Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd With a beat that's loud Huh, I'm black and I'm proud - irrelevant I'm black and intelligent I teach my kids to watch the education they give em Cause it's really all about street wisdom [ CHORUS ] True hip-hoppers don't bleed True hip-hoppers don't need True hip-hoppers don't speed No time for greed True hip-hoppers do read And will lead, not plead Will sow seeds that breed Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed True hip-hoppers don't slave True hip-hoppers don't crave Silver and gold, we're not amazed We live f-r-e-e If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me My philosophy keeps it plain and simple Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?

"Yes," she replied, "with potato salad on the side." And the teacher replied, "Well where do you reside?" She said, "Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride. If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified." The teacher replied, "It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide." She replied, "Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?" She was mystified and felt so dignified The teacher was coming to the house where she resides So she purified with pesticides 	{*sound effect: chemicals sprayed*} Called her friends up nationwide 	{*sound effect: phone being dialed*} Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side 	{*sound effect: food cooking*} You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide Natural juices and water purified Organic fruits brought from the countryside with silver forks and knives placed side by side 	{*sound effect: silverware clinks*} You could not be dissatisfied; looking out the window staring at the mountainside, you would have died 6:59 she's swollen with pride As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside 	{*sound effect: door knocking*} She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived 	{*sound effect: door creaks open*} But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried "Please, I smelt the bread from outside! One piece," and then she replied "The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived. You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!" The bum then replied, "When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied. Give me some of that chicken that you just fried." 	{*sound effect: food cooking*} She replied, "Chicken - fried? No that's for the teacher, you're not purified" Then she slammed the door and went back inside 	{*sound effect: door closes*} Sat on the couch with the TV Guide She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30; he still hasn't arrived Eight o'clock, she's on the downside Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed She's pissed off and her anger multiplied She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied with meeting the mystical teacher who lied Where could he hide? She ran down by the seaside 	{*sound effect: seagulls*} He was there teaching about - false pride "You lied!" she replied, "You lied! You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!" He replied, "No I have not lied. I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside. I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried. 	{*sound effect: food cooking*} And you said, that I wasn't purified." She replied, "I wasn't notified! I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!" And the teacher sighed, then replied,  "This concludes our lesson on false pride."

Look [KRS-One] So you wanna be a conscious rapper Can you handle the press and they negative chatter Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top? But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop Can you rock for the love of the art Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart? Can you REALLY stay loyal to God when your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard Can you handle the criticism People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em? Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it But when you spit they callin you arrogant? You better think about that before you rock to this Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it! [Chorus: *sung*] Think you can do what I do Think you can step in my shoes You have no clue what I go through You never felt my pain When they attack my name All because I have spoken the truth [KRS-One] To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way You critics got somethin to say At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice It could break you down, take you down, make you frown It could actually shake your ground But if you love who you are, and believe in that Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat Yes, I declare victory over the streets Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite Over the strong, over the weak I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat I know I want humble and meek So you better think about that before you rock to this Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh [KRS-One] Look! So you thinkin about bein a concious MC Well you gotta love God and you got to live free You got to see the life that others can't see You got to be the person that others can't be You can't be a S-L-A, V-E If you sayin to yourself, "This may be me" Then you know goin in that you work against sin Your very skills will kill the demons within So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes Nor the slavemaster's video shows Nor the rap mags, you know how it go Especially black mags, you know they don't know Just go to the crowd that you know will need you Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people That's what you look for, that's what you work with Cause anything else, is truly worthless You better think about that before you rock to this Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris' You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh [Chorus] - repeat 2X The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: KRS-One Album: Spiritual Minded Song: Trust Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [KRS-One] C'mon, gather round now, gather round now, look now How many times did you pre-meditate what you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind But in the end, everything came in time But before the time, you was losin your mind You was racin and rushin and fallin behind But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind to the ways and thoughts of mankind And seek ye first the Kingdom of God And things won't seem so hard You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout Trust and obey, trust when afraid Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear Trust when you here, trust when you near Trust when you down, trust when you found Trust when you clown, trust C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh Let's raise it up, c'mon, look [KRS-One] After you live and you learn then you see You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D You will be so free, you won't see no me You will only see the will of the almighty You sick of what?

Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!) They wish to battle BDP but they cannot They must be on the jock of WHO? (DJ Scott LaRock!) [KRS-One] Yeah, one-two, what? What? Grab any tape that you think is hard Put it in your tape deck and press record Get this - what's a real hip-hop emcee? Is it MTV? Is it BET? Is it five M-I-C's so the people can see? I mean, how you think you free when you act like property? Tell me, how can you judge an MC when he's rockin I mean, rockin it live, not pickin his cotton I mean, adjustin his clothes I mean, how do you know before you come to the show, and you're not gettin cheated That you're not gettin heated, that you ain't come to the club thinkin, "Uh-uh - I must have been weeded!" You got to be a educated consumer Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya All they want is your cash, ass, glass, gas and a flick When you ask for that autograph, they ass dash quick Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter He pulls his gat while we BUST OFF the gatler He's more of an actor, someone, into theater Not an upright MC with styles who speaks clearer! [KRS-One] MC's have no time for the bar Unless we politickin a tape to some drunk A&R We grab the mic and say who we are, KRS And start takin it to the chest of the best This is not a test or a demo This is when you let go of the limo, like many can't do They may wanna amp you and chant new, record sellin But movin the crowd is somethin that they can't do! [KRS-One] C'mon! You got to be mistaken, I am not your boy You fake what you creatin, playin wit'cha toys G'wan with all that bullshit bout you bringin noise Time for somethin more than PO-PO-POI-POI All of hip-hop ain't seventeen Some of us still go back to "Microphone Fiend" Back when it was just MC's and DJ's No video that come on and just replay [KRS-One] Uhhh... uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh We can never stop, forever we rock, take a listen The t'cha is back, cause rap's whack when I'm missin Me, I would never want the future to believe that when they trust to look back on us there was no dope MC's There was, all these rappers grabbin more and more money And now that I'm A&R they look more and more funny They rap for platinum plaques without buildin a cultural strategy worthy of our children!

Yeah, officer from overseer You need a little clarity? Check the similarity! The overseer rode around the plantation The officer is off patroling all the nation The overseer could stop you what you're doing The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing The overseer had the right to get ill And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill The officer has the right to arrest And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest! (Woop!) They both ride horses After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices! The police them have a little gun So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one (Woop-woop!) I hear it all day Just so they can run the light and be upon their way Chorus Verse Three: Check out the message in a rough stylee The real criminals are the C-O-P You check for undercover and the one PD But just a mere Black man, them want check me Them check out me car for it shine like the sun But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one Black people still slaves up til today But the Black police officer nah see it that way Him want a salary Him want it So he put on a badge and kill people for it My grandfather had to deal with the cops My great-grandfather dealt with the cops My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

In fact there is really nothing there for you If your life is not a can of goo Hip-hop is not a product; hip-hop is me and you What I spit will see you through I'm freein' you with knowledge of G-O-D in you (Chorus) (Verse Three) Foot soldiers, let's go - we got this The freedom to be really you that's what hip-hop is What can we really do? Reach for the top, kid Those that seek the bottom they shot stop and lock, kid We the inevitable, most credible And most are leaning back with the terrible squad Here to beat knock hard, this is the real truth Everything I spit be backed up with real proof Welcome to the underground Don't look for me in the mainstream, this is a whole 'nother sound Sound set we rock music in the streets In the schools and over the Internet Feel it yet?

[KRS-One] It's the teacher, class is open G Let's get open on the concept of votin, we begin the discussion by viewin democracy People power, a people ruled philosophy Democracy is a system of government Where the whole population is the sum of it Where the goverment can't move without its people Where before the law everybody's equal But take a look at the police and how they treat you Take a look at these corporations that cheat you Democrats and Republicans are all see-through Now we votin for the lesser of two evils Man, don't let 'em deceive you This is an autocracy, not a democracy But to call this a democracy without mock interest in the laws of society, that's called hypocrisy! [KRS-One] Democracy only happened one time in European history, now keep this in mind It was practiced in Athens overseas In 508 B.C. by Cleisthenes Citizens would get together on a hillside And decide how and if they was gonna ride But in 322 B.C. here's what happened Alexander of Macedon conquered Athens And that was the end of democracy Where the people had a say in their society Today, we gotta get more knowledge And learn about the function of the electorial college It doesn't matter who you vote for today The electorial college has the last say But that's another day, here's what I came to say RIIIIISE UP~! [KRS-One] In corporate sponsored elections, who's winning? This the wrong direction from the beginning Every candidate got scandal, they all sinnin Tryin to convince you, tellin you what they been in But the real issues, they get avoided While our children still gettin exploited Heh, they call me Blastmaster Kris Edutainment, that's what my tactic is!

Word up Ya'll know you're going through chambers now. Haha Check this out... [Verse 1: KRS-One] Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a deejay? And Napoleon in Egypt wrote graffiti? Did you know that history is just a replay And you affect it by what you do and what we say? Did you know that history is just a memory And we are the present memories of future centuries? You gotta know your history, the what and the how And be aware, you're making history right now So since history is a record of past events Let's give the future something it can respect (Uh, meta-historical Listen, listen Meta-historical) [Verse 2: KRS-One] History is a record of past events That tries to make sense of the past with past evidence [The life of a free man makes history in many ways But history makes the life of a slave] History is an art, not a fact And the historian, no matter how scholarly, is never exact We are living in an omni-event - Keep in mind everybody's doing everything at the same time The activity of the whole globe could never be recorded: Our linear vision is too distorted We think in terms of A, then B, then C, then D, then so on We say "this began here, that ended there" So our conversations can have something to grow on But in reality the omni-event has no beginning or end that you can detect We make beginnings and endings in mass confusion So we can talk about the things we're doing But this is all an illusion We see reality according to the symbols we're using Can words exist without letters? Can birds fly without feathers? Who changes? We or the weather? These words are forever, so I'm calling these oratoricals Meta-historical (Uh.. Meta-historical Beyond history) Look! [Verse 3: KRS-One] Meta-historical, I got so much more for you Hip hop is a culture; rap's not all we do When The Teacher's calling you to higher order, you Try to slaughter your own foundation What's wrong with you? We got so much more to do You order your history; history don't order you! Here's what we ought to do - I'm talking to you: Let's do this different from how these others do History documents its society - the physical society - not what's inside of me So my history will lie to me Cause it's based on physical space, not my psychology I got a new philosophy: it's called hip hop and it needs a new methodology Now follow me... History documents what's physically there Or what's physically here But hip hop is not here or there, it's not physical Hip hop is a shared idea; We all share it. From different dimensions, we all hear it But hip hop is all spirit So let's get down with what the truth is They're not recording hip hop; they're recording what produces Winners and losers, CDs and tours That's not hip hop; that's rap music folklore That's why these rappers are no more - Cause they followed no principles, traditions, and no laws That's why the future remembers me, KRS, rhyming for the century (Uh...

He got a problem, yo, he's conceited" I'm not conceited, they just couldn't beat it Cos when I'm in a club I like to mingle Seconds later they're playin' that single Loud as a collision and pumped up dramatically So the people in the place will automatically Time it, and dance right behind it Those that have it on tape will rewind it It's not surprising, we rock parties Anywhere, anyone, anybody Some sound shoddy, like cardboard But I'm blessed, praise the lord You see I like to study, I like money I like eatin' wheat bread with honey But to none of these am I addicted I like to remain free and unafflicted With the sickness of attachment The material road of entrapment Those that walk this road become weak They can't think, they can't speak Unself-sufficient, cos they're leeching I'm not dissin', I'm simply teachin' Well if you notice, not once Have I said Scott's name to gain fame See it's a shame that they're blinded If they had a piece of paper I'd sign it That's called an autograph, this is called a class I've only come to educate the mass Of young people, to this there's no sequel Just a message, be peaceful And loving, but not a sucker And stay away from negative motherfuckers They only pull you down with their hate But wait, here's somethin' to meditate...

It's like me against anyone First full verse is spontaneous, combustion thrusts me No rapper can dust me Bounced upon the scene with a theme, Word...Life I cut fantasy out cause I differ from a dream Wisdom lies deep in my molecules, you assumed I fell victim to, hip-hop blues You way off I stay on tour often rockin spots on the California coast, range you know back to Boston Enforcin my theory, leavin rappers teary-eyed Fly most who came and thought they had stride You accustomed to cussin and bluffin fussin for nothin Half of y'all crumbs are just soft like muffins I bake, masterpieces, sharper thesis Y'all candy coated motherfuckers stink like feces Needless to say, are these running shoes yours?
