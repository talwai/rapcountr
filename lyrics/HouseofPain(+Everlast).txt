Then breaks open the register drawer Pulls out the money stuffs it in his pocket Points his pistol then he starts to cock it The man panics and gun goes off Stupid old fool made Johnny blow his head off But he don't care cause Johnny was thought It ain't a crime if you don't get caught Chorus: Everlast It ain't a crime if you don't get caught (repeat 3X) That's how it is homie like it or not Verse Two: Evelast Now coming out store Johnny shot two Haisidic Jews And when he got home his face was on the news His mom freaked out told him get the fuck out That when the pigs rolls up, so yo he ducked out He hit the backdoor like his name was Carl Lewis Skipped to the payphone to find out where his crew is He called up his homeboy Jose, "Word up!" "Can I come over my man?", he said, "No way  a cop was here he was looking all over for you but I told the pig that I didn't know you" He said, "Cool meet me up at the school I need a ride cause I'm wanted for homicide" Johnny got a gun and now he's on the run But he don't care to him this shits fun Now that he's an outlaw sorta like Robin Hood The hard rock hero of the whole neighborhood If they catch him he'll wind up in court But it ain't a crime if you don't get caught Chorus New Chorus: Everlast It ain't a crime if you don't get caught It ain't a sale if it don't get bought It ain't a show if I don't get paid She ain't a hoe if you don't get laid The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: House of Pain Album: Same as it Ever Was Song: Where I'm From Thats Where I'm From X2 Back in the hub we used to drop madel Contemplate in hell The stories I could tell would Freak your mind And wreck your brain The thoughts I would have would drive most insane The band playin' Rain Gettin' Down wit' Jimmy Hendrix, and Page Make up the rage Back in the Huddle McLou's back yard Me and D was starvin' And times were hard Danny used to roll through Schemin' on the hustle Credit cards and slang M..MC bangin' Lethal used to come with his reel to reel We didn't have no deal But that wasn't the point, we'd...

Not speakin on my physical, my mental, or my aura I'm speaking on my soul, for to burn would be true horror There's no such thing as luck, your life is in the hands of God So do not treat his righteous laws with blatant disregard In order to follow the Lord's path, here's all you must do Do unto each of your brothers as you'd have them do you This golden rule is all you need, and you will be rewarded The man that don't, will pay the price and believe me, you can't afford it Because (This is everlasting) (What is it?) What is this? (This is everlasting) This is for the ones who war over whose God is the right one Can it be the Asian one, the black one or the white one? The answer to the question really isn't controversial There is only one God and his love is universal If you sin and crave redemption, all you need to do is ask him Then you will be fully prepared for a life that's everlasting So take heed to the words I say, grab a good book and get hip to The teachings of the holy Q'uran or the Bible's holy scripture Because (This is everlasting) (What is it?)

reasons, too many excuses And all these prescriptions, got too many uses I'm so lonely, it's kinda scary This kind of lonely is making me weary I'm so lonesome I could die Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before And I'm so lonely, I feel like crying This kind of lonely is worse than dying I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die I'm so lonesome I could die The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Everlast

loud now all a sudden it's silent Your premenitions say it's about to get violent You want permission just to blink your own eyelid I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win No stick moves, ain't no cap peeling Where I come from real men don't catch feelings We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin' The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling Mass appealin', done it since the 80's Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies Spend money like crazy, ain't got no babies If I don't make it in Heaven I'll run shit in Hades Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul It's in my soul, soul music And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul It's deep down in my soul, soul music Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul It's deep down in my soul Yo I shit on competition, spit on percussion Beats are bone crushin', one deep I'm bum rushin' Guns they get stuck in, someone starts buckin' The jewels that I'm truckin' got pimps upchuckin' You can't hold me down, you can't hold my hand A full grown man with the one God plan I

just fade away And I can rock the mic without no delay With my head to the ground everytime I pray You can catch a heart attack or get blown away Cause this type of shit happens everyday Feel the burn, I can feel it in my soul It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul Feel the burn, it's in my soul It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn Now I can see I got a good foundation

pushing a stroller Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder She looked like an angel, she talked like the devil She looked like a stranger, she lived like a rebel She's a sad girl, cause her man went away And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea Sad girl living on the east side

summertime you still smell like my favorite season And it feels like pain, it's just like pain Love is like pain, some people like pain Somewhere between the mountain and sea, a river is flowing Somewhere between the Earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing Somewhere along the road you might wanna hitch a ride Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride Somewhere inside you still remind me of a feeling Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing And it feels like pain, it's just like pain Love is like pain, some people like pain Put your nails in my hand, pain Fill my eyes up with sand, pain Papercuts on my tongue, pain We're right now where we begun, pain Somehow I only hurt the ones who really mattered Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered Someday soon I know my ashes will be scattered Someday soon I

Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly [Everlast] Flat footer on the street, rookie on the beat Looking for the crack spot, trying to hit a jackpot Have not, want not, gun shot, *Blough* Dirty cop on the prowl, it's all legal Fuck karma chameleon, Irish, Sicilian Heritage since birth, sold my soul for what it's worth From London to Perth, Tokyo to Paris Caught in The Abyss like my name was Ed Harris Trying to build this palace, heart's full of malice My soul's corrupt, I'm about to erupt Internal investigation's got me facing Twenty-five to life, I'm thinking kids and wife They cut me up, rough me up and sweat my connection Now they got us all under witness protection Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Before there was a lotto his people took your numbers Odds on the game, the point spreads over, unders Went to private school educated by nuns But like a pagan, lost his faith through the Gods of the guns A heist like the Briks, he iced ladies like rinks From pocket books to the minks, thought they'd never see the clink Slapped on the wrist, his case was dismissed You see money talks, yo, it pays if you're rich pops Grease the bulls just to bribe the judge Should have scared 'em straight, should of gave 'em tough love But that's when they hauled him from the jury to the warden Everybody had a price but this time they can't afford 'em Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Where do gangstas go when they die

just waiting Waiting for you, just waiting Well I know from experience That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice It wasn't yours in the first place And that's hard to accept when you love someone And you're led to believe that in their moment of need That they want what you want, but they don't Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would Baby you're no good And you hurt me like no other lover ever could Don't go making me cry, you're gonna say goodbye Baby tell me why Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify This waiting for you, just waiting Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting Waiting for you, just waiting Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting It was so easy in the beginning When you didn't feel like running from your feelings Like you are now, what happened, what do I remind you of Your past, your dreams, or some part of yourself that you just can't love I wish I could believe you Or at least have the courage to leave you Life has taught me that love, with a man like you Is only gonna make me blue But I love you anyway no matter what you do You don't come around here, like you did before When you did adore Tell me what I did to deserve this [Everlast] What you waitin' for, hun, come and get it Don't even sweat it baby doll that can wet it I treat it like a virgin and work it over time If honey's lookin' fine we can go the whole night We can do the deuce sweety pie, what's the news I bet ya when I'm done, hun, I know I'm true blue Cause I can get explicit, baby let me kiss it Get it while it's hot cause when I'm gone you're gonna miss it Sexual healin' baby that's what I'm dealin' Mirrors on the ceilin', come check the feelin' High pitch squealin', twitch it, jerk it I'm a stud like Captain Kirk and it's your body that I'm workin' Cause I can get freaky like a Friday I know you're going my way, naked on the highway Jump into the ride, I'll take you to the pent The name's Everlast, hun, here's what it is Waiting for you, just waiting I'm waiting for you, just waiting Waiting for you, just waiting Can't you see I'm waiting for you, oh, just waiting, my heart Finally I see a different man Only love can hurt like this can Finally I see a different face Tell me who is going to take my place Waiting for you, just waiting Waiting for you, just waiting Waiting for you, just waiting Waiting for you, just
