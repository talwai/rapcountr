But now I'm all grown and my dream came true Santana champagne, from here to you From the heart of Napa Valley and the guitar king Comes a sparkling wine, to make a blind man sing  Yo it's the cham-pan-yah, from the man with the bandana  I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana What's the first name in cham - it's Carlos And to that man I propose a toast In the 60's, he had lots of freebie sex But now he's gettin down with the DVX [Interlude] Excuse me fellas!

[Singer] Everything got outta control The music was so interesting Everyone got out on the floor It was a bunch of old white people dancing [The Lonely Island] Now picture if you will a bunch of business men Stuffed in the boardroom like pigs in a pen The ties around their necks are like a hangman's noose In the middle of the table theres' a boiled goose The old people smell makes you want to puke in the sink These dudes'll never dance - yeah that's what you think~! I stride in the room all young and hip Hold up my boombox, and say listen to this [Singer] Then everyone started to move People rejoiced instead of financing Your preconcieved notions were shattered By the super old white people dancing [The Lonely Island] The Big Apple, where people never dance Spirits go down while profits expand The cops or the dealers, who's got the juice The street venders peddling their boiled goose So many types of people, they'll never get along Till I bust out my boombox and play this song [Singer] The music washed away all the hate And society started advancing Every demographic was represented It was a rainbow coalition of dancing WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH! Everyone was wearing fingerless gloves WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH! I saw a Spanish guy doing the Bartman [The Lonely Island] Transport now to an old folks home Where the elderly are tossed on their brittle bones The orderlies are stealing, there's no excuse Everyday for lunch they eat boiled goose So I grabbed my boombox and hit the turbo bass And what happened next, was a total disgrace [Singer] Everybody started having sex The music was way too powerful A bunch of old people fucking like rabbits It was disgusting to say the least - OHHH!

So the very next day, stayed true to my word And I snuck on T.V., so I could be heard I said, "Rocky, if you're out there, I think you're a nerd and I'll lick you and bury you like a dog turd!" I got kicked out, but the candle was lit 'Cause the people had to know if my claim was legit It made the headlines and I got the call It was Rocky ("Hey"), and he wanted to brawl We negotiated terms and set the date Then I went into training to add some muscle weight While I punched on meat in a rickety shack He was sippin on wine, having models rub his back At the weigh-in, boy the tension was high! Me and Rock, toe-to-toe and eye-to-eye I talked some trash, we got pulled apart I shot him one last look to strike fear in his heart Skip ahead, the big night was finally here My body was ripped and my mind was clear We entered the arena to the roar of the crowd People chantin my name, I never FELT so proud Faced off once more in the center of the ring Touched gloves, said a prayer and the bell went {*ding*} He hit me with a left and shattered my face and a right sent my teeth all over the place Then another great punch caved in my eye socket He broke my jaw and my trainer yelled, "Stop it!" But nobody heard him and he crushed my ribs Blood sprayed off my face and onto some kids They yelled out ("MORE!") and Rocky obliged I had to think of some way to turn the tides So I lean back to hit him with all of my might Took a swing, but he caught me with a sucker punch-right Then a sucker punch-left and a sucker punch-right then twenty-two consecutive sucker punch-rights~! He tore off my arms, and beat me with 'em Then threw acid in my face, which obscured my vision He kicked me in the leg, and fractured my shin The bone splinter shot right out of my skin People barfed in the crowd, they were going insane! and Rocky punched my nose-bone into my brain I was quiverin and twitchin when I soiled my shorts Then Rocky pissed on me!

Call up my mom and get my cry on I order room service, get my apple pie on And after that, I just walk the streets A homeless dude throws up on my feet And I see just how pointless life is Full on existential crisis Tear off my clothes and scream at the sky Fall to my knees and ask God "Why?" [Santigold] This nightlife is killing me I think I'm losing my mind I yearn to fly, yet I sink Stalling tears is my dream [Andy Samberg] After that, I drive into the hills And trade my car for a bottle of pills And after that, I'm on a vision quest Put my mind, body, and spirit to the test And after that, I meet my totem spirit It's a rattlesnake, so I have to kill it Then I drink all his blood and steal his powers Slither around in the dirt for hours And after that I start jerking off Up on a mountain, jerking off Down by the river, jerking off And that's when I have my epiphany You can't spend your whole life jerking off And after that, I'm going back to the city [Santigold] This nightlife is killing me No more jerking off Fate only knows what's in store Stalling tears for me, no more [Andy Samberg] And after that, I clean up my life Join AA to make it right And after that, I get my thirty day chip And after that, I go celibate! And after that, I'm a whole new man Brew complimentary in my hybrid van I give my life to meditation Then sleep with a whore at a Greyhound station And after that, I have a full relapse Then lose my hand in a game of craps And after that, everyone calls me Claw And after that, I work for Tim McGraw (Hey!) And after that, I pass out in a sewer Meet a giant fish, fuck his brains out And after, that I'm filled with shame No one but myself to blame Nothing in my heart but pain And next week we're gonna do it again! [Santigold] This nightlife carves hooks in me I'm back to jerking off I tried but could not break free Stalling tears return to me Started in the club Then he moved to the Hills Really freaked out and drank snake blood Got himself clean Now back in the club And that's where I've been in this song But it's stalling tears This playboy life's too much for me [Andy Samberg] After the club is the after party After the party is the hotel lobby Stuck in a cycle I just can't win And after that, it all happens again The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: The Lonely Island Album: Turtleneck & Chain Song: No Homo Typed by: AZ Lyrics Dude you're pretty swoll have you been working out?
