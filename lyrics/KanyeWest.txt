And I was in the session with him I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?"  I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay." Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth just askin me to send him beats And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap" [No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"] I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer [Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"], I'm like oh shit I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also People were like this, started talking about the ghost production But that's how I got in the game If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here So you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work But shit just wasn't poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty." And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me so I went and um, I was listening to Dre "Chronic 2001" at that time and really I just, like picked the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life." And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the "Dynasty" album. I could say that was the the resurgence of this whole sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hiphop Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude" [Jay-Z: "You a real soulful dude"] And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it, one take. And he said, [Jay-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]  "Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"  [Jay-Z: "so what you thinkin?"] And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train,  man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to [Mother: "Come on, let's just go"] Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up [Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"], I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.' And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, "yo play that one beat for him." And I played 'Heart of the City.' And really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX. [Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like,  "yo what's up I'm Kanye." [Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]  "You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics" [Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]. You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said "man, that was tite." [Jay-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]. That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave Lotti fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]. I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up ["Y'all niggas is stupid"]. Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad. [Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]. Dame was like, "yo you got a deal with Capitol, okay man, just make sure it's not wack." [Dame: "you gotta make sure it's not wack."]. Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.' "I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow.  I got eleven plaques on my walls right now.  You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow." Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him, and he's like "oh shit" [Dame: "Oh shit, it's not even wack."] "I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot." [Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]. Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick" [Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]. You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--  the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do, man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal" [Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]. And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested, and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"

My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the fronting? Why y'all got all caps on? Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em Burn Hollywood burn Take too long for niggas to get they turn Probably be cremated before I get my urn They tried to tell me that aliens built the pyramids I swear life's a bitch, on her period For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx I make my jeweler add a few more links You can look at me, don't give a fuck what nobody think and my face always looking like somebody stinks [Chorus: Kanye West] My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy My chain heavy, my chain too heavy My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy My chain heavy, my chain too heavy Here we go, like we should Feel the sweat, on your face Here we go, like we should Feel the sweat, on your face Alright, okay Here we go, like we should Like we should, like we should Like we should [Kanye West] Question, what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross? No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime? That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe it's Mike time I keep that gold book on an ottoman and wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the eighteen-hundreds, y'all forget that I got called nigga on Twitter so many times yo I live that Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at Hey Realtor, I'm looking for a nice park Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark This is the flow that solar eclipses So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit they got us listening to, in this existence Don't give up now, just a little more persistence I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson Keep 'em away huh? Something might happen This is the making of a masterpiece So we broke out the chains and told the master "peace" [Chorus: Kanye West] [Talib Kweli] Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and straight jacket My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us The DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus Son a major factor in my decision to be a rapper was rebellion, being anti-establishment was attractive to a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got them thangs cooking Land of the juks where the lames get their chains tooken It ain't looking good for you if you a tourist here Sometimes our rhymes are on a frequency that only purists hear A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody scared Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars Question, do it gotta make sense/cents if it make dollars? Sick visions is living inside our brains It's like a sadomasochistic addicted to whips and chains Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane Spit flames when I visit the higher plane Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it 'Ye them a load of whores by the board's trust [Consequence] Uh, that old ball and chain had me chained up for weeks So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets And now when we link, she saying the game's over I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker Now the new dude she saying that could stay over should be a chain who goes by the name of Choker That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa So the chain's on the door, I'm on the way over But when I came over, his only response was you must be the owner of a chain of restaurants Cause I'ma eat your food for that chain that I want cause you be running round like the chain makes the man So it's obvious that he don't know the chain of command cause my chain commands that kind of respect And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day it spoke for itself, and this is what the chain would say Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy [Chorus: Kanye West] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kanye West (Kenny West) Album: The Cleveland Show * Song: Kenny Disses Cleveland & Rallo Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash * episode "Brotherly Love" from 2010 [CJ] Who are you?

I got you in the mood, for an interlude, Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude, But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview, I know you into me, so, let me get into you, I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin and rappin and *fuckin*, And passin the dutch and relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin, The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins, Just because we stuff 'em in the oven, My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick, Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it, Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue, Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick, They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady, But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know, Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?' We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'! [Chorus] x 2 I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars, Navigate through the truly bizarre, Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life, And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight, [Kanye] You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told you, oh, Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood, The only producer that feel like "fuck rappers!" Only backpacker with a chip like hackers, Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker, So if he say nigger, then I'ma say *cracker*, Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like.. I'm the shit (Uggh) You ain't figured out what I'm about yet, Always rockin that 'this ain't out yet', But this ain't 'bout that, From a city where niggers plug like outlets, Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so, When I go out, niggers always out to get me in the studio, And I ain't in the mood to flow, I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo, And they tryna act stupid, oh! In the club with Silicone Suzie, What happened to real girls like Rudy? With real titties like Tooty, This girl got a silicone booty! And got the nerve to act moody! Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy, But bitch you a man, you can't fool me! Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G... [Chorus] x 2 Talib: Break it down Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum, 'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs, You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun, Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb, I spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run? I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow, Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bojangles-ass dudes, Dancin around the club, doin the tango, Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles, Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

Morning, G.O.O.D. Night Song: Promise Land Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com [Malik Yusef] Now whatcha finna hear is an update On what we been on as of late See I was reading a late notice on the date that I wrote this, you hear Time flies in the Leer  And you wonder where the day went See I'm a leader in my field, but I'm behind on my truck payments So this is something that could help you raise your head like hello See this is not brown red or yellow Not a white or black poem This is a prayer to a guardian angel To protect our fathers. mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters Until we bring our troops back home Cause it feel like we all in the same platoon And we'll all be extinct soon If we continue to suffer from other people's crimes I think we well overdo for change  This time And I know they don't wanna see me cooped up in a Benz They'd rather see me cooped up these pens Therefore I release the ink that's cooped up in these pens And let my art-ticulate People are so slow to love, but so quick to hate Now some things finna change because we say so Lets stop looking at how bad things are And focus on how well they may go And this is a declaration That we'll be fair again Especially to those Americans Who were Americans, before there were Americans This is to a small young family that's booming out of space There's room in outer space This is to my people The human race [Chorus: Adam Levine] I need you to Take us to the promise land Don't just make us promises It's too late to let go of our hand [Kanye West] They say we need a prophet that can touch on the topics and make it hot as the tropics. Well you got it (you got it) [Adam Levine] Take us to the promise land Don't just make us promises It's too late to let go of our hand [Kanye West] Everybody saying please don't let go I hear it over and over and over like a echo I see it in my dreams, I feel the effect though People drowning in debt Somebody to the rescue Everybody's saying we need something special Nah man, we need something extra terrestrial Outta this world, speak for us  Be the vessel Outta the box, reach for it through the threshold  Uh, through all of the stress though What's best of all, people screaming like a festival Just applaud, this moment is special y'all [Adam Levine] I need you to And I need you to And I need you to I need you to I need you to
