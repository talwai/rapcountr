I said, "You can't get none!" Had a chance to run He pulled out his shotgun He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead He put the gun to my head and this is what he said, "Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear." We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin You think this story's over but it's ready to begin "Now I got the gun - you got the brew You got two choices of what you can do It's not a tough decision as you can see I can blow you away or you can ride with me" I said, I'll ride with you if  you can get me to the border The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter I did it like this - I did it like that I did it with a whiffleball bat So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun And right about now - it's time to have some fun The King Adrock - that is my name And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne." We rode for six hours the we hit the spot The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot This dude was staring like he knows who we are We took the empty spot next to him at the bar M.C.A. said, "Yo, you know this kid?" I said, "I didn't." - but I know he did The kid said, "Get ready cause this ain't funny My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money." Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky He yelled, "Stick 'em up!" - and let two fly Hands went up and people hit the floor He wasted two kids that ran for the door "I'm Mike D. and I get respect Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect" M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face The piano player's out - the music stopped His boy had beef - and he got dropped Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.

It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on I get so hyped when I hear this song It's gonna keep me happy like all day long So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong Don't grease my palms with your filthy cash Multinationals spreading like a rash I might stick around or I might be a fad But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad  Chorus [Scratching "Can't get enough of that funk"] "Junior..." The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Beastie Boys Album: Hello Nasty Song: Flowin' Prose Typed by: blohm@u.arizona.edu I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise To the interconnectedness that underlies The lies upon lies have lost their meaning The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being Over and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl It's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings I give in and I win I try to never complain Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage But I'll remain sane making gain without pain Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain And keep it positive as pains taking as it is I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live  I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live  I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live  So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme Coming like thunder with lightning timing No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas Woke up this morning right out of a dream Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme What can I do with these bones and flesh?  With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?  I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Gravy and King  His Holiness and all enlightened beings I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone I'll be the one who brings it inside your home  But the words ain't mine I just pass em along For Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes And more crimes are committed as I say these lines The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Beastie Boys Album: Hello Nasty Song: And Me Typed by: blohm@u.arizona.edu Once again I'm all wrapped up in me My best friends my own worst enemy Electricity and gravity Oh my god now take a look at me My life line's run by AT&T They got their wires all up in me Is push and pull the way it's got to be?
