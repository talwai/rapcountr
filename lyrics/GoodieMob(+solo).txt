You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out But i luv her till death do us part Though she divorced my pop the hard way Back in nineteen "yassey" for the past sixteen years I took on the responsibility of daddy... Ma ol' burd... puttin a real buzz in my ear, makin sho' it marinate And not go out the other ear Guess who? stood beside me when y'all wouldn't force fed when I Couldn't lift a spoon to my skull God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine ... Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste Now what that went with?? my ol' burd cried tears of joy When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession Of the "sawed off" runnin' out of spurs When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who Unlocked the doors, my Ol' burd puttin' my hairs out I better eat before you bug me to death Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass... I wasn't ready to eat yet but I enjoyed the dinner she said, "I'm glad" Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease, That won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin this Benz Again & again, told me not to and when I did... Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid My Moma didn't play, shiiit, I had to pick the switches... You guess who!!! My Moma, destination unknown, went out on her own She was barely even grown and became my Moma I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad I was glad cause I had my Moma For so long she had to be strong I know at certain times she was wrong But she still my Moma, it still amazes me The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be My Moma, the biggest player that I know I love her so Hell everything I got I owe to my Moma Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv I guess that was yo' way of preparing Yo' son to be the one and not the two To make you and my daddy's dream come true But what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed The sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised The family that you might not ever talk again But you talkin' so I know that you gon' walk again But take yo time, guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme... My Moma Who was tha first to hold you in some arms Tha first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm Your Moma, wit that drama brought you into this world From a world of down under I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school With that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt Around my waist that held my panst up Takin' back only got you closer to Southern Bell Got your forehead swell I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts With dreads and if I couldn't handle a situation then I fled Behind closed doors I froze, in Garnett holes I rose Who that hell got my bond Standing in front of that two-inch glass A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son... My Mama!! Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong Lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me I'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister Even though she pay the bills wit the mister Brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had Cause I was left at birth she knew it could work Since she gave me the first chance my song and dance Pearl, my world, what would I do without her spark Probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but I got a happy home Ever since my first day it's heaven sent now I know  What it's meant when I say I appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son... Guess who??? The only one that cares for real and really understands how I feel Help me over come my fears and never left me through the years So I dedicate this song for you, for all that you brought me through I know there will never be another that will love me like my Mother The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Goodie Mob Album: Soul Food Song: Serenity Prayer God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change Courage to change the things I can And wisdom to know the difference The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Goodie Mob Album: Soul Food Song: Fighting Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes} Put me in a serious situation hope I get another chance To live life as I know 4:30 was the time, I'm feelin' a pain in my chest I guess I smoke too much sess Makin' a nigga mo' slow off the doe in Olympian bubblin' under who Where's the crew thick mist in the trail I'm feelin' pressure off the tess Spine advertising swine on Channel 2 when in the same breath You tellin' me don't eat from that plate increasin' my blood Outbreaks on my skin don't blend with the way I want this thang to flow If I can help the cause don't have to treat it with no tricks You settin' me cancer on a stick, visualize destruction soon to come Throwin' within this city we call Atlantis Prayin' like a mantis everyday ain't good in the woods of Southwest I stress in my rhymes...fighting for yo' spirit and you mind!

But I got my crew Didn't come fo' no beef cause I don't eat steak I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy, Not covered in too much. Drinking a cup of punch- Tropical-every last Thursday of the month (Big Gipp): Daddy put the hot grits on my chest in the morning When I was sick, Mary had the hot soup boiling Didn't know why, but it felt so good Like some waffles in that morning Headed back to the woods Now I'm full as tick. Got some soul on blast in the cassette Food for my brain. I haven't stopped learning yet Hot wings from Mo-Joes. Got my forehead sweating Celery and blue cheese on my menu next (Koujo) Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still Tied face goons surround me like cancer Drill me with second-hand obstacles But, only to make matters worse Plus, I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie From Optima: staffing figure.

Glory is my mother: The baked chicken smotherer Filling me to capacity when I was younger "Sprinkle me" like Suga T, so I wouldn't have to wonder about life; about the streets that I walk up and down Grab a pen, and let it take me out of Orange Mound Far away, I spend my days chuffing hay Got "Inner City Blues," but I'm not Marvin Gaye Pray.

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Common f/ Cee-Lo Album: Electric Circus Song: Between Me, You & Liberation Typed by: eternalreflection7901@msn.com [First Verse] She rested her head upon my chest Sensed liberation in between breaths Wonder if sex is what she found it in Peace, found it laying down with men Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her It was more than bodies we shared with each other We layed under the cover of friends A place where many lovers began I began, to feel her body shake in my hand Body language, it's so hard trying to understand Usually after sex, it's a good feel Took by silence, emotion stood still I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille Hurt from before that began to build She told me hold me, a story she assembled it Tellin' it, trying not to remember it It was a story of innocence taken Thought she could redeem, through love makin' When she was eight she was raped by her father And tried to escape through multiple sex partners Felt pitiful, she had only learned, To love through the physical, inside it burned My heart turned, I thought of what this man did She forgave him, she grew to understand it Her soul was tired and never really rested Only with men through aggression Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason By speaking it, she found freedom Between me and you (echo) [Chorus - Cee-Lo] Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper Serenade her, without speaking a word Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me [Second Verse] She laid, I watched her breathe Happy to be here, not afraid to leave I couldn't concieve her not being here Death in her face her not having fear Less than a year she was diagnosed with it Memories of that year, so close and vivid Happiness, would only visit, once in a while To watch an adult, becoming a child Somehow, I knew she'd make it The life of one so given early would God take it? Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair I stare with my eyes closed Wonder when the body leave does the mind go Watchin' Jordan became less important Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs According to doctors theres no cure We went through doubt, and cases of insure Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs Knew a part of her I could heal with words But the (?) was (?) What seemed like the end was the beginning for her Like that, she didn't want us to remember her No more medication did she want us to give to her It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath Only to be freed through death Between me and you (echo) [Third Verse] He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled A lump in his throat, his fear built My whole life it was in steel This ain't the way that men feel A feeling, he said he wish he could kill A feeling, not even time could heal This is how real life's supposed to be? For it to happen to someone close to me? So far we'd come, for him to tell me As he did, insecurity held me I felt like he failed me To the spirit, yelled help me I'd known him for like what seemed forever About going pro we dreamed together Never knew it would turn out like this For so long he tried to fight this Now there was no way for him to ignore it His parents found out and hated him for it How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him No longer he said had he hated himself Through sexuality he liberated himself Between me and you (echo) Liberation...

Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you You start thinkin about stuff...tryin to make the right moves  So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it  Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn  Began, began with time  Bein my bloodline is one with the divine  In time brotha, you will discover the light  Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White  Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right  I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear  The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear  As a child, given religion with no answer to why  Just told believe in Jesus cuz for me he did die  Curiosity killed the catechism Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to  And became a slave to master self  A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health  My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons  Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital  And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys  You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief  But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em  And use religion as an emblem  When it should be a natural way of life  Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right  That's who got you doin right and got you this far  Whether you say "in Jesus name" or "Al hum du'Allah" Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you  You let that show towards others in the things you do  Cuz when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne  Only 144,000 gon get home  Only 144,000 gon get home  Only 144,000 gon get it baby  Chorus: Cee-Lo I've lived and I've learned  I have taken and I've earned  I have laughed, I've cried  I have failed and I have tried  Sunshine, pouring rain  found joy through all my pain  I just wanna be happy with being me  [Cee-Lo] Let me voice my concern  So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title  That their actions didn't earn  Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence  Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince  I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place  Cuz it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know  Who you are in the first place  So I try to find the clue in you  But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do  Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am  So I began my search, my journey started in church  It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief  Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets  Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with  And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school  It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only  Science and math are universal  Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran  Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites  Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White  Some leads were granted with insight  and it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand He still created with the imperfection of man  So, with followin' I disagree  By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but  I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind  That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity But one side you gonna have to choose  Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession  become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and  Can't follow your lesson  If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown  If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own  If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own  If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own  Well, I've lived and I've learned  I've taken and I've earned  I have laughed, I have cried  I failed and I have tried  Sunshine, pourin rain  I found joy through my pain  Just wanna be happy...bein me  Bein me The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Common f/ Cee-Lo Album: Universal Mind Control Song: Make My Day Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com [Chorus: Cee-Lo] Ah, the sun is shining brighter 'cause you really make my day Yeah, you really make my day Ahh-ohh-ohh...

We make this movement towards freedom for all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle. Yeah. yo, check it- There were lights and sirens, gunshots firin Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh No room to rest, pain consumed each breath Shot twice wit her hands up Police questioned but shot before she answered One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on to life. She thought she'd live with no arm that's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit Put guns to her head, every word she got hit "Who shot the trooper?" they asked her Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her Her mind raced till things got still Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex They lied and denied visits from her lawyer But she was buildin as they tried to destroy her If it wasn't for this german nurse they woulda served her worse I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me? All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all. (Cee-lo vocals) I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes. Listen to my Love, Assata, yes. Your Power and Pride is beautiful. May God bless your Soul. (Common) It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her Walkie-talkies cracklin, I see 'em when they takin her Though she kinda knew, What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six inna morning Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in a cell, one cot, no window, facing hell. Put in the basement of a prison wit all males And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read Two years inna hole. Her soul grew weak Away from people so long she forgot how to speak She discovered frredom is a unspoken sound And a wall is a wall and can be broken down Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with One of the brothers she had a child with The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed Out of this situation a girl was conceived Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution And lactated to attack hate Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick And said she robbed places that didn't exist In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites Through dark halls of hate she carried the light I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me? All of this shit so we could be free. Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me? All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people- (Cee-Lo) I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah. Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah. Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful... May God bless your Soul. Oooh. (Common) Yo From North Carolina her grandmother would bring news that she had had a dream Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean What made them real was the action in between She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens The fact that they always came true was the thing Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun It's time for her to see the sun from the other side Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when She untangled the chains and escaped the pain How she broke out of prison I could never explain And even to this day they try to get to her but she's free with political asylum in Cuba. (Cee-Lo vocals) I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah. Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah. We're molded from the same mud, Assata. We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah. Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful... May God bless your Soul. Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful... May God bless your Soul. Oooh. (Assata) Freedom! You askin me about freedom. Askin me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, cause I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is. Uhh, the way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to blossom. Freedom is -is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do.

I hope the mothers stand strong You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone (I wish) And I - wish I could give every celly some commissary And no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly And I - wish that D.O.C. could scream again And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again Shit - and one day they can speak again I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN I wish that enemies could talk And that Super-homie Christopher Reeve could still walk (I wish) I wish that we could walk the path stay doin' the right thing Hustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game (Let's go) [Chorus: Cee-Lo] Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today Take this music and use it, let it take you away And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way I know it ain't easy but - that's okay Just be hopeful [Verse 3: Twista] Wish the earth wasn't so apocaliptic I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it We can make it, always so optimistic If you don't listen, gotta live my life the best way that I can live it I pray for justice when we go to court Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war Why can't we kick it and just 'em on And in the famous words of Mister King, 'why can't we all just get along?' Hope we can find a better way to shop in peace And I - hope we find a better way to cop for keys And I - wish everybody would just stop and freeze And ask - why are fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies You can be wrong if it's you doubtin' With the faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church (Let's go) [Chorus: Cee-Lo] Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today Take this music and use it, let it take you away And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way I know it ain't easy but - that's okay Just be hopeful (Repeat) Na na na na na na na na na Just be hopeful (Repeat) Na na na na na na na na na Na na na na na na na Na na na na na na na The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Twista f/ Big Zak, Cee-Lo, Jazze Pha Album: Adrenaline Rush 2007 Song: Say Say Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com [Intro: Jazze Pha] Whooooo!

Your life is being requested And you are being tested, so make every attempt you can to expect the unexpected." [Hook] Mm mm mm Boy that Lo boy DAMN Oh Lawd Cee-Lo why you do it like that?

Hello! I go by the name of simply Cee-Lo Green - how do you do? Welcome. I thought I'd seize this opportunity to tell you a little  bit more about myself if you don't mind. This is my vision. YouknowhatI'msaying? Check me out now. Uhh I have millenniums of material and rivers of rhythm An entire ocean of emotion that's enlightening to swim in Also a forest of feeling, beaten paths of peace Trapped inside my silhouette I have to speak to release Demanding more from the pen than I horde from the pen The line between playing to win and sin is thin But I walk it with grace and I talk it with taste I am that raw, simply put, and I rest my case; it's elementary Yet far more than resources to pay the rent for me Everything that I've done is divine Ask God, he'll tell ya, yeah, he mine So, you see, you don't need another thug out of me That is the last thing I plan to be on this LP But I'ma go slip into something mo' comfortable and continue the lesson No inconvenience at all, I insist on leaving an impression So relax, and ride out. Relax, okay, and ride out Just relax, and ride out. Players, relax, and ride out I also solicit visual verbalism worth a visit Intensely exquisite artism inquire all. Who is it? It's a deliciously daring delicacy I eat to exist Oh, he's waving those words, I want seconds and thirds Oh, hush. That's awful kind of you, you're making me blush I could use some competition, but they not making me much Man, this beat is like my master, it's making me bust Hip-hop is suffering, meaning I'm a necessity, if nothing But you like every other rapper - cornrows and a bandana But I get a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check every three months off Santana Don't you fuck up, though, my family is the whole side of Atlanta Now, how can I say? Okay, let me just put it this way If anyone ever contests my conquest my gun best Yo son just, takes one time to be one less Til you run and tell the rest that I'm the best I sang sweet, but brang heat to bang meat We all on the same street And it's not that often I verbalize the essential element of surprise I am not one of these thug rapper guys But this one will help you realize, and use both eyes to recognize the type of action that this amount of money buys Now listen son, let me drop some shit on you man I can just "do-do-do-do-do-do-do" and put a hit on you man Aith hot heat that will make your heart beat quit on you man And Mr. Dawson'll find a pretty box to fit all you man So relax, and ride out. Just relax, young man, and ride out Hey, you better relax, and ride out. Okay? Just relax, and ride out I could take that shit all day But if I only had sixteen more bars to live I'd get high, and hopefully O.D. on an alternative I'd give a dim lit dream, a colour scheme And I'd swim for the sun (so far) no matter how impossible that may seem I'd bury my feet in the foundation of a forest Becoming one with everything there I would be long. I would be right and wrong. But I'd be rare And then I would pretend I didn't care. Use my fear And pray that my forever would be fare. And I love you all, unconditional, I get misty already missing y'all And then I forgive those who rhyme to kill the time While mine cultivate the consciousness and Chill the spine, heal the mind, yet still sublime Ride out. Relax, and ride out. Relax, and ride out. Relax, and ride out This is one for the road. Yeah. One time for your motherfucking mind I told how you motherfucking play. D.F. y'all. Believe this.

You see, everybody is somebody But nobody wants to be themselves and If I ever wanted to understand me I'll have to talk to someone else Cause every little bit helps And I can go on and on and on... but who cares? Feels like... the surreal life But it's still nice Wish I could live twice but I still might if these bones heal right I see a little light though it's still night Feels like... surreal like But its still nice Wish I could live twice but I still might if these bones heal right I see a little light though it's still night And I can go on and on and on... but who cares?
