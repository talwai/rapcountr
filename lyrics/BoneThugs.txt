Now they didn't have to shoot that old lady down like that.  They didn't have to do that!  It's one old woman in that house.  I've got burglar bars there to try to protect her.  I've got mercury lights out there to keep it bright and light.  I'm as mad as hell! And somebody's gon' answer to that!" "Police are defending the shooting death of a 92 year-old woman.  It happened as plain-clothes officers burst into her home last night  to serve a search warrant for drugs.  Police say they made an undercover drug buy at the house earlier in the day.  The woman's niece said there were never drugs in the house  and her aunt lived alone and probably just panicked.  The family is furious."

Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk Pullin out a silly club, so you stand with a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand But take off the gun so we can see what's up And I'll go at it punk, and I'ma fuck you up! Make you think I'ma kick your ass and drop the gat, and Bone's gon' blast I'm sneaky as fuck, when it comes to crime But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me And any asshole, that threatens me And I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope Takin out a cop or two, they can't fuck with me! The motherfuckin killer that's mad With potential, to get bad as fuck Now I'ma turn it around Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound {*BOOM, BOOM*} Yeah, somethin like that but it all depends on the size of the strap Takin out a police, 'll make my day And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say [Chorus]  2X [Layzie Bone] + (Krayzie Bone) I'm tired of these motherfuckin jackings Sweatin my thug, while we be thuggin in the shack and, shinin the lights in my face and for what? Maybe it's because I'm kickin so much butt I kick ass - nigga maybe cause I blast on a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin with the trigger of an Uzi, or, an AK Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say They put out my picture with silence Cause my identity alone with my group causes violence Bone with the criminal behavior Yeah I'm a Thuggsta nigga, but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got? A nigga in a uniform waitin to get shot by me, or one of my niggaz And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger (Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool) And as you all know, Layzie Bone came to rule Whenever I'm rollin, keep on lookin in your mirror And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a dumb motherfucker with a gun And when I'm rollin off the 8, you'll be the one that I take out, and then I get away And while I'm drivin off laughin this is what I say Believe dat [Krayzie] You're motherfuckin right Original Hip-Hop Lyrics Archive The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Album: The Collection: Volume One Song: War (Battlecry Remix) Typed by: btnhresurrection2000@hotmail.com Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely nothin', nothin', nothin'...
