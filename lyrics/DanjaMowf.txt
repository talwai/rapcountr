[Javon]   Vultures plotting on my demise   Stool pigeons tell lies while the caged bird cries   [Danja Mowf]   Yo, But as long as the mighty eagle rules the skies   Black men keep dropping like flies   [J] I'm watched like a sparrow in some Godly eyes   [D] Finding peace like the dove is a compromise   [J] Yo, as long as the mighty eagle rules the skies   [D] Black men keep dropping like flies [Danja Mowf] Yo, it's only right that I take flight (Where?) To the sky, floating like a black butterfly I try to make my migration pleasant But living in the present gets you shot down like a pheasant The reason seems that every day is hunting season At least on the block where the black birds flock Some of these birds choose not to soar the sky They just stay in some shit, making them more like flies Day in and day out another one dies (I got it, another fly nigga got swatted) The time he was allotted it seems just ran out Or could it be the fact he didn't let his wings span out? Acting like a chicken scared to leave the coup Cause the chicken doesn't fly, he just stays with the group Chilling with a bunch of turkeys waiting for Thanksgiving If he had of flown South he might have kept on living cause [Danja Mowf] .44's and po-po's don't scare these pros In the nighttime ducking from constant shot bucking They stuck in fly paper, for making paper is fly Cause the eagle's on the paper, now you understand why? When the eagle rules the sky, many black men die Chasing eagles then get scavenged by the vultures nearby, hear by Reducing us like calories, shot down like ducks in shooting galleries Please freeze these mentalities That's holding you back from getting busy like bees In trees you rest, building your nest with cess Soothing your bird chest from stress, you just buddha bless Yes, every block or two them hoes will find a cock-a-two With no penis cap and get you caught in her venus trap Indeed, don't be dropping your bird seed Pollinating wild flowers, it's all in your power cause [Danja Mowf] The caged bird sings but his songs get muffled Feathers get ruffled, it's a struggle in the everyday scuffle I tried to warn him about these snakes and cats They hardheaded like woodpeckers and they blind as bats That's the reason I keep preaching but you In denial like the owl always talking about "Who?" I should call you a parrot cause you act that way Fronting around a bunch of niggers, repeating what they say Thinking that you're fly pimping around like a peacock But your turf, your whole earth consists of only three blocks Take them keylocks off of your mind Take a journey out of the ghetto just to see what you can find And like the raven said to Poe and only told him "Nevermore" If from your door you never go then any more you'll never know See how some other guys live their lives, not like flies Realize your limit ain't the skies The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Danja Mowf Album: Word of Mowf Song: Vowel Movement Intro: AEIOU and Sometimes Y Chorus: Once and a while we got to move these vowels, once and a while we got to move these vowels, If I got styles and you got styles, then once and a while we got to move these vowels A = Speedis Toine I specialize in snatching vertebrae. Break your anatomy down to A, call me atomic sensai. AKA B.J. McKay, and his best friend bear will hit you with Shirley Murdock and you can sing as we lay.

I'm nice on the mic but that ain't hard for you to see, this rap thing I got locked, I swallowed the key. Now peep the stee, cause since the year of 93 I've been known to eat, chew, sh_t, stew an emcee. Quite frankly, the day that you'll see me, is the same day you'll dunk and jump from the top of the key. Reside on northside but see sometimes I be, getting biz at the crib of Lonnie B. & and; A.D. Recognized from Japan all the way to NYC, still feel funny when I see my face on B.E.T. Till the day I die and have a preacher yelling over me, I wanna be known for representing VA vicinity. I shake rapper's off like I do after I pee, get it clear "From Where???" the debut C.D. I = Danja Mowf It's hard for me to understand why! People wanna test me when they know they're gonna die. Me oh my, why they wanna try like a sister with no thigh trying to do the butterfly! I, say bye bye like Guy, then dive into your a_s buckaroo banzai. Dry your eye, please don't cry, I sing a lullabye before I sting you like a horse fly. Of course my, style will make you testify. I bet you fry like a pie on an electric eye. F a sword I ain't no Shang-Hai samurai, but in your boti boy head boom bye bye. O = Lonnie B Yo! Every since a brother went solo I've been known to grab the microphone and kick the Willie Bobo. Far from so-so when it comes to sex even your Ho know. We did it To-To style for an hour at the hojo. Here's a photo of her sucking on me like a rolo, and in this one she was cumming or either thinking about some Go-Go. I turned your little Ho into a dancer like JoJo, or maybe like Donnie, Poo Poo and Fo Fo. It's true-yo. I am a Little Vicious like Cujo, cause I keep three glocks in the trunk of my Peugeot. Mess around you'll be missing like that crew called Menudo. They wouldn't find you if they searched from Mercury to Pluto U = Kalonji The Immortal I'm talking to the letter U, as if U were a person, on an abstract avenue where I construe. The vowel moving U, into, an accented zoo, that's making you go ooooh. You, be trying to find styles like a clue, so I left old ones on the floor like residue. See what you saying now, to me ain't nothing new, you got a glass jaw making this style see through. My brain is a point of view holding knowledge unseen like cats on a oriental menu. Kalonji the immortal, styles continue, to stay sharp like a tuxedo dressed Gingsu. To who, is two, or more too much of a  crew of true friends who be super like glue. If it's you, don't argue, cause I'll still pursue to move the vowel you asked me by saying was that you?

I recognize that voice that's the girl i invited -'I hope you can forgive me for bustin in ya house' -'My friends had to know why they call you Danja Mowf' -'There's thirteen of them, and thirteen's unlucky' So she climbed on top and number fourteen ------ -- .....

Nothing Rap about that [Danja Mowf] Yo, just a thought but I was wondering What if underground were to hit, would commercial be the shit? A universal role-reversal -- imagine that Where a cipher's too commercial and some corny rap is fat Would Hammer then get props, and did Ras Kass sell out? Your moms pumping Organized Konfusion through the house? St. Ide's was a soda and they legalized the blunts and everybody smoked em and the President had fronts Would niggaz sportin afros and dreads and the braids switch to jheri curls, and high-top fades? And rappin bout the streets wasn't cool The underground would pump non-violence, safe sex, stay in school So who? Be real, could you choose? (nah) When re-al-ity and commercial-ity both fuse? But I've got news check it out we're on the way (what?) to making this happen everyday, so I say Question: Do you have to be from the hood in order, to know, how to rap good? Question: Do you have to pack a Tec-9 Serve jail time, to learn how to rhyme? Question: Do you you have to be a gang banger or drug slanger, to be a rap singer? Question: Do you have to be an alcoholic or a drug fiend, to make green on the rap scene? Check it out, I was chillin in my crib With my hand on the dial, bout to watch a video for a while Freestyle rules, yes indeed The song's about hustlers, smokin mad weed And how many gats you can tote in your coat And how quick you pull it, and discharge the bullet Are real O.G.'s, the real MC's? A brother out the pen with the pen writin sin Can you tell me then -- if you knows why the do's always close when I shows with my demos, suppose it's the clothes (nah) Shoulda choose those Timbo's or talked about some hoes in my flows (that's how it goes) Yo it's cool if you live that If I can't relate, are my rhymes less fat? Cause I'm not a hustler, a gangster, a player or a G I'm just an MC bein me, so I ask Question: Do you have to be from the hood in order, to know, how to rap good? Question: Do you have to pack a Tec-9 Serve jail time, to learn how to rhyme? Question: Do you you have to be a gang banger or drug slanger, to be a rap singer? Question: Do you have to be an alcoholic or a drug fiend, to make green on the rap scene? I don't wanna sell my soul to go gold or pack a gat to umm, go plat-i-numm If my pockets fat then umm, let it be from how I come A smart intellectu-al, poet of the streets Recitin over beats, representin with the pen I don't pack nines, but known to carry tens in fingers, ten funk bringers, they known to bring funk to a punk like a trunk full of skunk, PEE-EWW I see you, peek-a-boo, who got a weaker crew, here's a technique or two Pay-Per-View nigga, for the true niggaz, not the ones pullin triggers but the ones whose the father figures WHOA, that's a radical idea, imagine that But who would wanna hear somethin in they ear positive Instead of somethin glorifyin just how triflin they live, so..

Every time Mad Skillz and Danja Mowf combine, MC's lose they minds  (One time) Yes my crew be the baddest  (Two times) Come and enter the Mowf of Madness [Danja Mowf] Hold up, while I give my soul up to get some platinum and gold up On my wall and to control the Music that I make and how it's sold but Knowing if I blowed up the underground would treat me colder Than they supposed to, really makes me want to fold up My rap book and say "It's over," plus I'm getting older And making art doesn't hold up in the industry That wants they pockets swoll up, so Puff's got it sewed up And if I switch remember that I told y'all Cause staying true to underground goals ain't something that I owed ya Cause if I don't make hits, I'm gone Cause no hits mean I don't make no money so I'm gone But if I make a hit to the underground I'm gone So if I'm signed or I'm unsigned still in time I'm gone So when I step the hell off, why not be living well off No matter how I play y'all still gonna say I fell off  Every time Mad Skillz and Danja Mowf combine, MC's lose they minds  (One time) Yes my crew be the baddest  (Two times) Come and enter the Mowf of Madness [Mad Skillz] The results of me in a MC blackout Attitudes get caught so you either whipping the mic or the mac out Instead of writing y'all cats chose to take the slack route Either place you act out and we can have a smack out Rappers think they leading, I'm soon to get 'em Apply pressure to MC's just by sitting in the room with 'em Every rapper is my enemy And I don't even speak no more unless there's a beat in my vicinity Huh, I grab mics for the glory And run with two tight-ass dykes that smack the hell out of a rapper for me Crush niggas, drop at the bus niggas Shut your top lip, prophecy, and hush niggas I touch MC's and leave 'em wishing I have shoulders shifting like your ass was in a cabbage patch competition After you lose to Mad Skillz it's on Take your Face/Off like Nick Cage and dip it in chrome, so what's up?  Every time Mad Skillz and Danja Mowf combine, MC's lose they minds  (One time) Yes my crew be the baddest  (Two times) Come and enter the Mowf of Madness (Repeat 2x) [Danja Mowf] All these record labels is Jive Ichiban ain't the one, I break Big Beats down to size And crush 'em like American Red Ants in France By the thousand, and get a Penalty for Ruffhousin' Now my wild Profile is known East West and Universal Virgins on Mercury know I hurt you I told the Warner Brothers that they'll get smacked Loud in LaFace On PayDay, I eat a rapper A-Day With DefJam on 'em, my Priority never switches Your Unit got no Flavor cause your Vinyl ain't Delicious Which is the reason we have planned it Electrocute you all and throw you into the Atlantic, what? [Mad Skillz] Yo, f a beat, cause I'm a rhyme to the crack of your bones I got you singing like Mariah, you changing tone Over here MC's get no wins Cause Mad Skillz is not the one, identical twins Personality split with perfect timing, and my sould could leave my body And whip your ass while I'm rhyming You facing the unmasked Jason If I kept you with a pen and a pad, you'd better have a job application  Every time Mad Skillz and Danja Mowf combine, MC's lose they minds  (One time) Yes my crew be the baddest  (Two times) Come and enter the Mowf of Madness (Repeat 2x) [Female Singing] One time, two times, bet you gonna lose your mind (Repeat til fade) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Aaliyah f/ Danja Mowf, Mad Skillz, Lonnie B Album: Are You That Somebody (Remix) 12" Song: Are You That Somebody (Remix) Typed by: DanjaMowf@aol.com, OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash * * send corrections to OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Danja Mowf] Uhh, Danja Mowf (WHAT?
