Milk's bodyguard, is my bodyguard too You wanna get hurt, well this is what you do You put your left foot up, and then your right foot next Follow instructions, don't lose the context Thirty days a month your mood is rude We know the cause of your bloody attitude "Beat biter! Dope style taker!  Tell you to your face you ain't nuttin but a faker!" (repeat 2X) Your style is smooth, even for a cheatin mic You shoulda won applause as a Rakim sound-alike Here's a Milkbone, a sign of recognition Don't turn away, I think you should listen close Don't boast, you said you wasn't braggin You fuckin liar, you're chasin a chuckwagon The only way you learn you have to be taught that if a beat is not for sale, then it can't be bought When you leave the mic, you claim it's smokin Unlike Rakim, you are a Joke and I think you oughta stop, before you gets in too deep Cause with a sister like Lyte, yo I don't sleep "Beat biter! Dope style taker!  Tell you to your face you ain't nuttin but a faker!" (repeat 2X) When I'm in a jam, with my homegirl Jill My cousin Trey across the room with a posse to kill So I step in the middle, shake it just a little Wait for some female to step up and pop junk Give my cousin a cue, treat the girl like a punk Now I'm not tryin to say that I'm into static But yo if you cause it, yup, we gotta have it Cause I ain't goin out like a sucker no way So I sit around the way for you to make my day We can go for the hands, better yet for the words Cause you'll be ignored, and at the same time, I'll be heard throughout the city, the town and the country The beat is funky, my rhyme is spunky There is no delayin in the rhyme I'm sayin Neither are the flaws of what my DJ is playin So SIT BACK Jack, and listen to this It's 10% Dis.. cause I'm just about ready to fly this fist against your lips! But I'll wait for the day or night that you approach and I'ma serve then burn ya like a piece of, toast! Pop you in the microwave to watch your head bubble Your skin just crumble, a battle's no trouble Get my homegirls Dohni and Kiki to get stupid This thing called hip-hop, Lyte is rulin it I hate to laugh in your face, but you're funny Your beat, your rhymin, your timin, all crummy On the topic of rappin, I should write a pamphlet Better yet a booklet.. Your rap is weak homegirl and it's definitely crooked! Others write your rhymes, while I write my own I don't create a character, when I'm on the microphone I am myself, no games to be played No script to be written, no scene to be made I am the director, as far as you are concerned You don't believe me, then you'll have to learn This ain't as hard as MC Lyte can get And matter of fact, you ain't seen nothin yet! So never let me step into a party hardy Talk to some people and then hear from somebody 'You wanna battle?' cause you know where I am You don't wanna come in the 90's and see me at a jam when a, mic is handy, ten feet away I stretch my arm like elastic, head like a magnetic Set assure, you know I don't play When it comes down to it, the nitty gritty For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity "Beat biter! Dope style taker!  Tell you to your face you ain't nuttin but a faker!"

It goes to my head as just chit chatter You may take this egostistical or just or worry free But what you say I take none of it seriously And even if I did I wouldn't tell you so i'd let you pretend to read me and then you'll know. Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze. That I despize those who even try to look into my eyes to see what I am thinking. That dream is over you gotta sink it. And I tell all of you like I told all of them what you say to me is just paper thin, word I'm not the kind of girl to try to play a man out I take the money and the gear and then break the hell out No thats not my strategy, not the game I play I admit I play game but it's not done that way Truly when I get involved I give it my heart I mean my mind, my soul, my body I mean every part But if it doesn't work out, yo it just doesn't It wasn't meant to be you know, it just wasn't So I treat all of you like I treat all of them and what you say to me is still paper thin In one ear and right out the other hurt is mumbo jumbo (eeeish) lover I don't pay attention I don't concentrate you ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this a-hah, a-hah, a-hah Sucker you missed, I put feelings aside I know who I am My name is Lyte is your name Sam? Cause if it is step off, grab your coat and get lost Wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope And hit the road Sam, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more Hit the road Sam, don't you come back no more So now I take precaution when choosing my mate I do not touch until the third or fourth date Then maybe we'll kiss on the fifth or sixth time to be me (mmmuaah) kiss Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete and then maybe I'll let you play with my feet You could suck the big toe and play with the middle it's so simple unlike a riddle It's as easy as counting to 1-2-3 in other terms, letters L-Y-T-E I'll tell you, you, you and all of you in the back and in the middle in the front Yo, that's it paper thin word up Lyte checkin out Special dedication to my DJ K-Rock in the place to be The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: MC Lyte Album: Lyte as a Rock Song: Lyte Thee MC Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [MC Lyte] From now on it's not MC Lyte Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC Tackling, anyone, who tries to stop me from fulfilling, the ultimate, the ultimate goal Suckers takin up room on the microphone I do pay for crowds, move over, stop stalkin me I feel like I'm drownin and fans are just stompin me Bigfoot! Should we buck the uncivilized But I'm so tame I don't, mean to criticize But why you sweatin we don't, go together Especially if I'm muggy in the rainy kind of weather [Chorus: chop up this phrase] "Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC" [MC Lyte] Competition I take it as good for the soul Pull back the microphone, let my arms unfold Release all the anger, all the aggravation Convert it into words just sorta like a conversation I am the talker, you're just the listener Talk and I'll ignore you, is it that offensive to you? The problem is you can't understand the logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you merely step aside, what all, call the weak But you'll also step aside when I'm, comin down the street You'll give me lots of room, to whistle and walk And then everything is silent just in case I wanna talk But I, I never do, small talk I like to hear Other girls rap and you say that I'm whack~?! Comin from a female that is totally dedicated Every rhyme I say you ought to appreciate it And if not I'll tell you like I told my neighbor Dana Betty What?

And I did, pronto, quick fast How much longer would the torture last? In the wrong place, at the wrong time It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind Death, it was gettin closer, right behind my back Ready to attack I got shot in a shoot-out, and then I died I could feel it, I was on the other side In between lives, I'm so confused What do I do, oh, what do I do? But was it really time for me to go? Why, oh why did I need cappucino? Why, oh why? Why, oh why did I need cappucino? Why, oh why? Why, oh why did I need cappucino? Why, oh why did I need cappucino? But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends That I knew in a past life, way back when A couple had died in a drug world And this one guy died fightin over his girl Another died drivin while intoxicated Why do people make livin so complicated? But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her But she wouldn't listen, no one listens I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream So glad to be given - my life back So good to be livin - or is dead better? I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs I didn't have to worry about fallin from a plane But at this café was death still callin my name? Or did this café even exist? And was my name just another on the death list? I knew it couldn't happen, even though On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of cappucino... Cappucino Cappucino Bust it, to some of you that really don't know I break it down to you, the word 'cappucino' It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it? But when you start drinkin... shit, it'd be workin I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best But if everytime I drink I voyage through death I leave it alone and just stick to tea Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me Why, oh why did I need cappucino?

MC Lyte are shown] When in Love (3X) When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight But at the end of the night, everything is alright Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat It'll only get as wet as I let it baby I love hard, I've done some effed up things from kicking them in the Nerfs, to throwin away his ring So if you love me, love me and stay with me But you can walk if your plan is to play me I'm not embarassed, nor am I ashamed To say once in the past, I've been gamed But that was then, and this is now And there's no way damn it, there's no how Although you gotta go through the good and the bad Pray to the one up above it's not a fad You'll do some crazy things when in love Those in love know what I'm speakin of When in Love When in love you do things that are strange Look back and say, "I must have been deranged!" I'm talkin like pickin your lover's nose cooking his food and washing his clothes And if you thought that was goin too far What about givin him the keys to your car? You could be partyin and havin a ball but you stop and check your messages to see if he called How about sittin in the house all night waitin for the phone to ring -- that ain't right! But you do it anyway cause you love him to death And if he was dyin, you'd give your last breath You gotta go through the good and the bad Pray to the one up above it's not a fad You'll do some crazy things when in love Those in love know what I'm speakin of When in Love (2X) When in love you go out your way to please him Wait outside his job, hope that you see him And guys buy girls some serious things like two-seater cars and diamond rings I know what happens, she got you strung Guess it doesn't matter long as you're having fun Love'll make you do some crazy things Meet a married man and then have a fling Like Babyface said, "Love makes things happen" It's most important, to hear what I'm rappin Someone in love better take your time Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes Although you gotta go through the good and the bad Pray to the one up above it's not a fad You'll do some crazy things when in love Those in love know what I'm speakin of When in Love (6X) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: MC Lyte Album: Act Like You Know Song: Eyes are the Soul Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash He knows he's leaving, not much time left Holding on to his very last breath I saw him last week, nervous and uptight Losing sleep, stays up all night Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed to push in the bush but took his time to get to know the girl he slapped skins with shared needles with Wish he could go back, change the direction But now he's got the infection I spoke to him, gave him inspired words I'm sure he's heard live by the sword, die by the sword What's left, pray to the oh Lord You can deny but the truth will unfold because the eyes are the soul 	Eyes are the soul.. 	Eyes are the soul.. I look into his eyes, but he's so high from the crack, he thinks that he can fly He has problems he doesn't like solving Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving 19, his eyes full of tears He hasn't smiled at least for a year His mom is gone cause he was high one night while they killed her, because of the crack pipe He's wanted by the law because he's robbed at least three grocery stores He's lost, all control Take a look, eyes are the soul 	Eyes are the soul.. 	Eyes are the soul.. 	Eyes are the soul.. I look into her eyes, she's so young but I know, where she's comin from I've watched her grow, little girl down the street White shirts and skirts with pleats She cried, fear in her voice Not knowing, she had a choice Oh so sad, oh so lonely If she knew that she's not the only one in school that didn't use the caution Facin, raisin a baby or abortion Her mother said she had to leave Who wants to be where a baby is not received No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N. to put it to an end She's learned a lesson I suppose I can tell, eyes are the soul 	Eyes are the soul..

There are SO, many distractions Those that see the Lyte, just a fraction Those that don't, remain blinded The Lyte is there, they can't find it One by one they fall in the darkness And it's sad, to take part in this But I'm hoping, that you just might get together and Search 4 the Lyte Now finding the Lyte is what's so difficult And you can bet, that the results are splenderous, wonderful, yeah What wouldn't you do? Cause once you've seen the Lyte, been with the Lyte Got to the Lyte, got in the Lyte I know that you just might never ever wanna leave the Lyte The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: MC Lyte Album: Act Like You Know Song: Act Like You Know Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash * DJ cuts and scratches "This is MC Lyte.." * [MC Lyte] Moonroof open, in the B.M.

How's everything goin, huh, how ya doin? Hope everything's fine, ooh, and umm can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits? And the address, so I can come visit?" I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them cause George looked good, MMM damn good! And if I didn't, some other girl would In my mind, I hope for the best Convincing myself that this was not a test Cause I heard many things about Georgie Nothing kinky, like no orgies I heard he knows how to make love like an angel from the heaven above Who was I kidding I'd give him a try Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission   "Can it be I've stayed away too long" (2X) I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes "She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised" Good conversation, over the phone He began to come for me whenever I was alone George was sweet, so nice and so neat With any other guy he didn't have to compete George was mature, he made sure that he was the only one I'd ever adore Girls, have you, ever had a friend that you'd get with, every now and then? I know for a fact George had a lot of girls spread out from state from state around the world As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me! But if I ever saw one, that would be the end He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend The girls I didn't care, fine legs don't lie See cause Georgie was into making your girls cry   "Kissed the girls and made them cry" (4X)   "Kissed the girls and made them cry"   "Can it be I've stayed away too long"   "Kissed the girls and made them cry"   "Kissed the girls and made them cry"   "Can it be I've stayed away too long"   "Kissed the girls and..." George was clean, no drugs and such But once in a while, he'd drink too much Hangin in a club where they play rockers Him and his friend, drinkin vodka I was lookin for him, and I found him there With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair I told him he was messin up he wouldn't go far He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car I said, "Don't drive, use your head Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead" We begin to argue, bad words were said Then he got kicked out by some longhaired dread Ran into the car as if, in a hurry He started the car but his vision was blurry He didn't care, he drove off into the night Riding for miles, without his headlights Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind He was still young yet running out of time Last week he took tests as the doctor told him George had cancer in his lungs and his colon See when he was young, he started smokin Paid no attention when he started chokin Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck Till Georgie Porgie, crashed into a truck I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much How he made me feel with the slightest touch Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin Wish he was here so I could say somethin The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow Just to say no one is promise tomorrow If you love someone you should say it often You never know when they'll be layin in a coffin Wake up, it's important that you know that No one on Earth is promised tomorrow.. Believe that!

At the bar, his name was Zeke the Freak He just moved in down the street He introduced himself and bought her a drink Before she could refuse, she didn't stop to think More and more alcohol, now she was intoxicated He picked her up off her feet, as he escapaded down the block then he opened the door as he struggled to get in, then put her on the floor He went to the door to make sure that it was locked As he bolted all of them, he looked up at the clock It said one, or maybe he'd be done in two or two and three, eventually, how freaky could he be? He began to think what should I do firstly? I'll get a little drink, because I'm very thirsty He got a little OJ, to make it really OK Grabbed a wad of Hubba Bubba, but didn't use a rubber They did it for three hours, he jumped into the shower Got out and towel dried, and screamed, "I've got the power!" He came out of the bathroom, she was still on the floor He said, "Heck I've got to wreck," then he jumped on for more 	Lola.. (uh-huh) she was a showgirl.. 	with yellow ribbons in her hair.. 	and a dress right up to here.. 	She met this guy named Zeke.. 	who was truly a freak.. 	And she didn't stop to think.. 	before she took that sunrise drink.. She finally awoke, eight o'clock in the morning Not remembering a stroke, as she began yawning Zeke the Freak thought he was thick and slick But what Zeke did not know is that little Lola, little Lola from the Copa used to be a hoe Now he's paid, thought he had it made But Zeke the Freak got AIDS 	Lola.. she was a showgirl.. (yeah) 	with yellow ribbons in her hair.. 	and a dress right up to here.. 	She met this guy named Zeke.. 	who was truly a freak..

Empire Boulevard is where I first saw the nigga and he tried to play hard But - I knew the deal, cause I knew his brother Jerry And Sam he just broke up with his girlfriend Terry So, Jerry introduced Sam and I that night He said, "Hello my name is Sam" I said, "Hi my name is Lyte" We dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat about - this and that, from sneakers to hats He said "Look, I'm in the mood for love Simply because you're near me" (Let's go) To my house, lay back and get nice Watch television, a-Reunite on ice I said "Umm slow down, I know you wanna shake me down But I'm not one of the girls that go rippin around" "Just like a test, just just like a test" "Just just like a test I cram to understand you" [MC Lyte] Next month - I finally went to his house I walked into the door there was a girl on the couch I said, "Who's the frog? The bump on the log? You chump, you punk, how could you do me wrong? Singing sad songs about your love is so strong" You said "Wait Lyte, you're confused, the girl is my cousin" Your brother agreed, but later said that she wasn't [repeat 2X] "Just like a test, just just like a test" "Just just like a test I cram to understand you" [MC Lyte] Forgotten, next month, we went to the Deuce Well, I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice You knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody Asked ya how you met 'em, said you met 'em at a party These girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff I said "It's not your business, so shut the fuck up" They said, "Oh - okay Lyte, think what you wanna think But it's gon' be some shit when yo' man becomes a fiend" I said "Look, to bust a move, I don't even know you To put it Lyte, I really don't care to" They kinda got mad and sort of offended They said "We only lookin out for your best interest" I said "Thanks but no thanks" in an aggravated tone "When I wanna find out, I'll find out on my own" [repeat 2X] "Just like a test, just just like a test" "Just just like a test I cram to understand you" ("Back into time") [MC Lyte] Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named Cee Well I'm calm, I'm thought, "I wonder who she could be" You're spendin all your time with her and not a second with me They say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K I strain my brain lookin for a name, to fit this spellin But I just couldn't do it cause my heart kept yellin Burnin, beggin for affection from you Sam But just like a test I cram to understand you Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man but "Just like a test, just just like a test" "Just just like a test I cram to understand you" [MC Lyte] Then it came a time you started lookin kinda thin I asked you why, you said "Exercise - tryin to stay slim" I bought it even though I knew it was a lie Cause it really didn't matter, you were still lookin fly But oh no, oh no, you started askin me for money Butter me up, beg me and call me your honey So I gave you two yards, and then I gave you one more You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door You came back an hour later and you asked me for a ten I said "I've only got a twenty" you said "Give me that, then" I said, "Nope, I'll tell you now, you better stop slobbin Find you a job, or you better start robbin" So I stepped off, a-with a giant step Picked up my belongings, and I just left And now I see you in Empire every Sunday Juicin the girls up for some money and a lay But every time I see you doin it, I just ruin it Tell 'em how ya on crack, smoke, sniff, and chewin it As for this girl, Miss C, oh well I was shocked as hell when I heard Samuel When your homeboys told me, I almost went whack that the girl you was addicted to, her name was CRACK~!

I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.  Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper.  Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a  Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot?  Surely I can, if you the man.  I get loose and produce large amounts of juice.  Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang get it on.  You're gettin' warm.  I can feel you getting closer.  Now baby, down this Mimosa.  You better believe it's time to give a toast to.  The woman of the decade, too bad to be played.  Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade.  All over your body.  Who's body?  You're body.  I can rock a party like nobody.  Leavin' time to take home the loot.  Choosy about who I let knock my boots.  Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte.  Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right.  CHORUS: Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world.  Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right, right... Ah, ah, ah.... Beware of the stare when I step into peace.  I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released. Now who from the chosen shall I choose?

Pulling 69 ways in my archive.  Sweet like licorice.  Sugar for my booga.  Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee.  I got shit to make your ass write a bad check.  Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat.  Beat on my drum if you feel the need to. As I procede to Open up and feed you.  I got a longing to put you where you wanna be.  Been I can, I get rid of all company. CHORUS Many have tried strict regulation.  Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation.  Those that didn't perform well.  They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell.  You're playing with my time.  Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me.  You better work me.  While you got the oppurtunity.  To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E.  Only the strong survive.  Only the wise excel.  Once said by my born-in-hell. Only the lonely die slowly.  Left all alone try to control me.  Easy does it never ask how was it. Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets.  Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute.  To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot.  But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it.  Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it.  It's natural. Never be ashamed.  Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.

Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a  Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot?  Surely I can, if you the man.  I get loose and produce large amounts of juice.  Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang get it on.  You're gettin' warm.  I can feel you getting closer.  Now baby, down this Mimosa.  You better believe it's time to give a toast to.  The woman of the decade, too bad to be played.  Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade.  All over your body.  Who's body?  You're body.  I can rock a party like nobody.  Leavin' time to take home the loot.  Choosy about who I let knock my boots.  Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte.  Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right.  CHORUS: Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world.  Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right, right... Ah, ah, ah.... Beware of the stare when I step into peace.  I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released. Now who from the chosen shall I choose?  Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes.  I found me a new nigga this year.  That know's how to handle this here.  Now I look forward to goin' home at night.  Brother does mo right.  Under the candlelight.  Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?  I guess I can.  Can I, why not?  If I wanna guess I can. Can I?  More honey than a bumble-bee hive. Pulling 69 ways in my archive.  Sweet like licorice.  Sugar for my booga.  Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee.  I got shit to make your ass write a bad check.  Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat.  Beat on my drum if you feel the need to. As I procede to Open up and feed you.  I got a longing to put you where you wanna be.  Been I can, I get rid of all company. CHORUS Many have tried strict regulation.  Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation.  Those that didn't perform well.  They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell.  You're playing with my time.  Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me.  You better work me.  While you got the oppurtunity.  To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E.  Only the strong survive.  Only the wise excel.  Once said by my born-in-hell. Only the lonely die slowly.  Left all alone try to control me.  Easy does it never ask how was it. Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets.  Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute.  To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot.  But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it.  Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it.  It's natural. Never be ashamed.  Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.
