Decision, based on intuition You love and keep your distance Hug and kiss in friendship (Marc 7) An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with Disrespect was not intended but your feelings sparked the sentence Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent (Hook) - repeat 2X (Soup) Man, too bad that we became friends first I'm not on expert on how relationships should work But, (echos) from the minute it as known It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up Over you, all my buddies would swoon But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn) But to me girl, you're still off limits No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, whatchu doin after this?) Infactuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended So I wouldn't lose the friendship Maybe, I should spill all my guts Or write a letter, then tear it up Or do a song, just to say what's up I want ... just ... a touch (Hook) - repeat 2X (Nelly Furtado) I can't do this anymore See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door Friendship turns into lust and this only tip That I can't comprehend even if I knew it Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling You got someone else, don't wanna be caught stealing Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone in the roo-ooo-ooom (Chali 2na) This was a lesson in friendship I stress in this sentence Should women and men be friends first? And then slip? My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of devotion (Akil) Opposites attract And best friends make a perfect match If you only knew that Once you cross, ain't no turning back The minute you let him in it and he hit that That's that (Marc 7) We was people to begin with, but you was too relentless Jeporidizing kinship, respect is intended Resolve is my intent While we got it in I'm tryin to salvage a friendship (Hook) - repeat 2X The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Jurassic 5 Album: Power in Numbers Song: After School Special Typed by: poppenfresh@hotmail.com [Kid] You guys workin' on a new album?

You love and keep it distant, hug and kiss in friendship [Marc 7] An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with Disrespect was not intended but your feelings sparked the sentence Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent- the perfect man Please understand my rhyme is your repent [Hook: Jurassic 5 and Mya together] We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line I love ya like ya was mine, think about ya all the time Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line I love ya like you was mine, think about ya all the time Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line [Soup] Man too bad that we became friends first And I'm not an expert on how relationships should work But {*echoes*} from the minute it was known It changed the whole tone, the way we spoke on the phone Yo it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up Over you all my buddies would swoon But I felt we were in tune You let me up in your room (damn) But to me girl you're still off limits No matter all the times that I hinted (yo, what you doin' after this?) Infactuation was authentic But yo I just pretended so I wouldn't lose the friendship Maybe I should spill all my guts Or write a letter then tear it up Or do a song just to say what's up I want... just... a touch [Hook: Jurassic 5 and Mya together] We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line I love ya like ya was mine, think about ya all the time Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line I love ya like you was mine, think about ya all the time Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line [Mya] What happens if we cross the line? Can't take it back, can't ever go back Damn you're such a good friend to me now But the attraction's undeniable See I know ya as my brother but could see you as my lover So what am I gonna do now?

But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues So let me speak on the drum [Chali 2na] Media is teaching the young Debate about belief in the one can make an eight-year old soldier fall asleep with a gun While tax man's hands deep in your funds, raping your ones Money tight like we tweaking the drums, it's like we speaking in tongues But no book burnings or church sermons I surf currents, my words burn like a dirt furnace Confusion leads and anguish sells But this music succeeds where even language fails to convey, free honest expression It's a problem trying to get people to acknowledge progression My goal is to leave a lasting iconic impression Controlling crowds like demonic possession, and ain't no time to invest in biting the hand that created the platform Attaching pseudo-patriotic crap to rap song Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one And yet we treated like we're speaking in tongues So here we come [Chorus 2X] [Suffa] + (Pressure) I would never, hate someone for the way that they laying with someone else (And if you do) the blame comes from the weight of the way that you see yourself Take some of the weight off your plate by taking the hate away and then maybe you'll make your way to start loving yourself Fear's a cancer, logic is a countermeasure A property that you can't count or measure I got a problem with people who got a problem with the way that other people wanna live (that's their prerogative) No matter how you love, where your prayers are going The anger's like a drug no matter where you're from But fuck a redneck checking if your visa's valid They act like pigs and chickens, I'm sick of Caesar salad So we seize the mallet, and we swing on the ignorant Can't speak our language? Then we'll see if you can sing in it Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one and yet we're treated like we're speaking in tongues So here we come [Chorus 2X] [Bridge 2X] They pick me up just to pull me down March to different drums, come from all around It's like we're speaking in tongues It's like we're speaking in tongues [Chorus 2X] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: K'Naan f/ Chali 2na, Mos Def Album: Troubadour Song: America Typed by: AZ Lyrics uh huh uh huh uh huh oh this takes me home it makes me think about sitting outside of my old home when I was younger and singing something like [Chorus I (with translation)] gabar yaroo subhaano [Young beautiful girl] maro shabeelo hirato [wearing tiger-patterned] maro qafiifa huwato [light, thin clothing] maga'aaga ii sheeg [Tell me your name] magaeygu waa sharaf [she says: My name is Sharaf] sharaf haaji weeyan [Sharaf Haaji, it is] aqalada hariirta [Those beautiful houses] dhina baan ka jooga [I live beside] alla ya u sheega [Somebody please tell them] tinta u shanleeya [give them a clue] nahoy zamzamey [of you, Zamzam] sabaah nuurey [who shines like the morning light] adoo kin kin iyo [like the scales] kaluun badaneey [of a colorful fish] adoo hajka jira [while you were gone on Hajj] xasuus badaneey [had many memories] sahiibtaa asho ashaq baa dilay [Your friend, Aisha died of love] ugu dambeyntiina [at long last (I realized)] aniyo geeluba [both I and the camels] wa u banaanbahnay [need love] [Chorus II -
