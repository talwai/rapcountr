your life experienced a day where nothing at all seems to go your way no matter how hard you try to get out of the rut you just could not break the string of bad luck a day where Murphy's law takes over your life and you just can't seem to do a darn thing right and when the day was over you just had to say you said man it's just one of those days my day started off kind of cool I brushed my teeth I comed my hair and I got dressed and went to school I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack a tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack about that point I proceeded to class I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed I went to my room which was on the first floor I had no idea what I was in for I sat in my desk and minded my own business someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it this girl walked in my imigination ran wild she stole my heart just by the way that she smiled I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt she said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut the teacher turned around while my arm was extended she looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended I said your tripping it's just a bad habit she put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip then I just shoke my head I said I don't beleive this she sent me to the head of the discipline staff I tried to play it off so I started to laugh I said ha ha this story is great it's a big misunderstanding one big mistake he didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile he said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child I stopped laughing and I said why is that he said just get out my school and don't you ever come back I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it he handed me my books and said yep you'd best beleive it as I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze and said man it's just one of those days I woke up around a quarter to eight I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise  I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine I hopped up and put my feet on the floor ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door the pain was immense as it started to throb I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job so I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys then I prayed out loud car start please the car started but what good was that I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock the bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous I got real mad because the sign said out of service I started hiking it I wasn't liking it I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner there was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner slamed on the flat I did 180 turn peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn with the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk I thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work I could've got away I almost had 'em shook til this girl walked by something said not to look but I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt but she made me miss the sign that said men at work I screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade I saw my whole life flash before my face I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars that was stupid I got off track cause about that point everything went black the next thing I remember is a head ache nagging I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead a big Flinstone lump on the side of my head they took my picture and my finger prints I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince I demand that you release me you incompetent fool you can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules you got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights but then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche I had a call so I called my boss I figured I might as well what else could be lost boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today he said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday stuck in a cell scared as hell I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways but for now it's just

I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cuttin no slack To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps In actuality, I mean in reality The words that you use are a mere formality Vocabulary is not what it's about The point that you're tryin to get across is what counts Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson That it's not the words that count, it's the message They get a lot of big words out of some magazine And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean They stand up on the stage, huffin and puffin Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin Really but a lot of jibberish And I know that they all wish They had access to fresh rhymes like this I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top [ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ] Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz Good looks and charm and personality You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me I know the same goes for the rest of my crew My deejay Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too The ultimate combination of strenght and prestige My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite The time is right, so don't fight it Suckers, please don't bite it We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top [ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ] I really hate to brag about him But when people doubt him I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him 'United we stand, divided we fall' Is the moto of our crew and it's honored by all Of us, we pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse And it enables us always to come out first We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot Yo Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top? [ VERSE 4: The Fresh Prince ] We succeed everytime we attempt To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt >From the rules set forth by us, of course you know Stay out our way or behold the brute force of Me Jeff and Ready Rock C We're a trio, oh, you didn't know? That means That there's three of us, one for all and all for one And we're takin it to the top before we get done I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine I insist on a rise and I despise a decline On the day I descend, that's the day I resign I'm creatin my trends and innovatin my rap Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that! My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have Anything that you want, the sky is the limit Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it Cause I came a long way from the past till today Now I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way! I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince Album: Rock the House Song: The Magnicient Jazzy Jeff Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch Some deejays are (good) some deejays are (fresh) Some deejays are even (def) But here's a little somethin 'bout my deejay (The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff So bust this beat (Disc) (jock) Yo Jazzy [ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ] Well, it's true that I'm the reigning king of the throne But with all my strength, I couldn't do it alone I need a deejay like (Jazzy) to back me up So when I'm rockin on the mic he's on the crossfade cut Scratchin and mixin, mixin and scratchin Second after second it's the record he's catchin His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle With the turntable split and the mixer in the middle Back and forth his hands fly With the speed of a cheetah that'll puzzle your eye Record after record, he has no mercy Cuts left, cuts right, then he cuts vice versa I'm not exaggerating, I said it and I meant it I resent it if you say that his cuts are precedented He's a lean, mea,n wreckin machine He gets respected like a king when he's on the scene So bust a move, cause you know he's def He's my deejay (the magnificient) Jazzy Jeff [ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ] People often ask me everytime I emcee Why do I brag so much about my disc jockey? Well, the reason that I brag and I boast the most Is cause my deejay is the most from coast to coast (The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff, wack destroyer Cuttin up records like a samurai warrior If you deejays don't know who I'm talkin to (I'm talkin to you) so (come on) Cause in a battle you cannot win Cause my deejay will (tear yo butt limb from limb!) He's like a runaway tank, a hip-hop rebel And if you wanna battle, you best bring a shovel My man, so you can dig your grave Cause there's no way that you could ever be saved Because (the deejay cuts the record) to create the sound (The deejay cuts the record) he's the best around (The deejay cuts the record) you know he's down His name is Jazzy Jeff a/k/a Jeff Townes Commandin the cut he's always on track He's DJ Jazzy Jeff and he's a cut maniac So for your personal safety you should be told That my DJ Jazzy Jeff is (out of control) (Oh my God) (Out of control) (My goodness) Alright Jazzy We gon' do somethin a little different right now This is what I want you to do for me I want you to tell all these people your name Jazzy, tell em your name (He's Jazzy) (His name is Jeff) Yo Jazzy, I want you to tell all these people How many of those deejays out there can get with you (None) (None of them) How many? (None of them) Tell the truth (None) (None of them) (None of them) Now make the record burp ( *Jazzy Jeff produces burping sounds with the record* ) Say excuse me ( *Jazzy Jeff makes the scratch sound like an 'excuse me'* ) Now make it sound like a bird ( *Jazzy Jeff makes the record sound like a bird singing* ) Now make it chirp ( *the sound changes from singing to chirping *) [ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ] Now here's a story that should not be forgot About the day my deejay turned into an autobot He got struck by lightning in an electrical storm He got on the wheels of steel and began to transform ( *Jazzy Jeff transforms* ) His name is Jeff, and he's as swift as a swiff The type of guy that other deejays don't want to have to reckon with He's by my side as I rock the mic All of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you They'll delight you, you know that that's right, if you Were a stick of dynamite, his cuts would ignite you The deejay on the weels can't be matched So (check out Jazzy Jeff with a cold cut scratch) (Good) (Jazzy) (The magnificient) (Jazzy Jeff) ( *JJ brings James Brown's 'Funky Drummer' into the mix) (Ain't it funky) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince Album: Rock the House Song: Just Rockin' Typed by: lyrics_galore@hotmail.com Each and every day when I come home from school Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom I secure the door and it's the moment of truth I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble A discotheque is what my room resembles How loud it gets to me it does not matter I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter The blast falls off my neighbour's wall My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls But I just let it ring and I don't go near it I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate I'm in my own world and this realm is great We rock this power at my command The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand The lower frequency better known as bass Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace My neighbours complain they say they can't endure They form a congregation outside my front door Mothers who yell saying its too loud Start banging on my door to turn it down My response to my mother when she starts knockin Is come on mum I'm just rockin [Rockin'] [Ready, rock C] This style that's mine is rarely heard Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe People gots my rhyme the super computer The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee So hold the red cup when we take to your knees Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime To all other rappers you're being subdued I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude This introductory performance has just one plot A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk Do yourself a favour and take a walk Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and I'll strangle you I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator The crown chief of the poetry industry Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy highly respected by the public at large The prince will rock is taking charge I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible You want a battle me man be sensible I'll never submit to any other emcee Be a duel to the death either him or me And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut If we kill a wack crew or two so what We just rock it We just rock it DJ Jeff Break 2 On each occasion that I perform The force captures my body like a magical storm Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock Adrenalin rushes my ego swells And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel My metabolism quickens my body gets sense That's when I metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince And as I display all my lyrical beauty You become a slave as your hype increases And as I vocalise I can see it in your eyes You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red You scream oh my to what the prince just said As my energy is drained from being so crushed All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush It happens each and everytime that my dj spins More commonly known as my second wind The spotlights are beaming You are screaming From my body all the sweat is streaming Commanding the stage And perpetually frayed Giving my all to the pulse of One hundred percent everytime I rhyme When I step off the stage that's when the stop And that has been the account of the evenings events Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin (what does it all mean) I'm just rockin Rockin rockin rockin Go crazy [Fresh] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince f/ Ice Cream Tee Album: Rock

I bought new clothes to wear everyplace But all Theresa would say was (Get out of my face!) So I gave up this quest for Theresa But then on the day my record was released, a Strange thing happened when it came on the radio Theresa broke her neck just to say (Hello..) I looked at her, I said, "You must be foolish Why did you ignore me on the way to school if You were interested?" She said (Oh, I apologize) I looked deep into her dark brown eyes I said, "You ignored me for months on and Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend? You didn't talk before, so don't talk now, be quiet What, you really like me? Huh - don't even try it!" [ Jazzy Jeff ] Man - she had a lotta nerve, man [ Fresh Prince ] Word man Hey man, but she ain't had half as much nerve as that old record producer, man Remember when he dissed us, man? [ Jazzy Jeff ] What - what up? [ Fresh Prince ] When I first started rappin I had one idea And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist I would give my all and work my hardest But when I took my song to a record producer He told me that I better go drink some rap juice, or Something, cause my song was really absurd He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard You know my ego was shattered, he busted my groove I could hear him crackin up as I left the booth (Ha-haaa!) I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble The title was 'Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble' Luckily I found someone who had faith He lifted my ego back up into place His name was Dana Goodman and he thought my song was on track So two weeks later it was out on wax It busted up the charts like a hydrogene bomb Up, up, up, up it clim-clim-climbed I made people eat the words that said I couldn't achieve Now they had no choice but to believe In me, then no sooner than my record came out That same old producer started callin my house One night he called me 'bout at half past 12 He said, "I've got some cash if you wanna sell" I said, "You big, stupid, half-wit idiot I told you before that my record was a hit But you just laughed like I was some kind of kid Now don't you regret what you did? I wish you'd get off my tip, yes, that's my request You see, he who laughs last, always laughs best Okay, I'll be reasonable - You wanna buy it? Okay, I'll sell it - psych - don't even try it!"

Jeff's aight) (But when your 'Magnficient Cuts' were released All of that laughter ceased) Word (When you and I used to do our shows All the crowd would say was 'HO, HO, HO') Yeah, time after time we were tearin it up While you rocked the mic and I rocked the cut But now that I'm makin a name for myself All those deejays are like (Yo Jeff, what's up?) But all that stuff is dead, no, I ain't with it They approach me on the street and say (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a ticket Man, to your very next show?) But I say no and I tell em where they can go I can't believe that they had the nerve To hop on my tip now! (Yeah man, word) Just the other day homebody approached me on the street And said (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a record for free?) I said, Man, the way you dissed me, you better go buy it!

I'm the Rapper Song: Nightmare On My Street * Typed by: brians@compusmart.ab.ca, WvW * The full length version appears on "Greatest Hits" [Fresh Prince] Now I have a story that I'd like to tell About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell! He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred! He wears the same hat and sweater every single day And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway! He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street! [Fresh Prince] It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right And we had just gotten back off tour last night So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies I got Angie, Jeff got Tina Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life That was all right because the lady was chill Then we dipped to the theater set to ill We saw Elm Street and man it was def And everything seemed all right when we left But when I got home and laid down to sleep That began the nightmare, but on my street! [Fresh Prince] It was burnin in my room like an oven My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30 It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked When I heard this awful voice comin from behind It said, "You cut off David Letterman, now you must die!" Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was Broke outside my drawers and screamed, "So long, cuz!" Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin Then thought, "Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin" I strolled back home with a grin on my grill I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince But Freddy killed all that noise real quick He grabbed me by my neck and said, "Here's what we'll do. We gotta lotta work here, me and you. The souls of your friends you and I will claim. You've got the body, and I've got the brain." I said, "Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong. I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long! Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work. The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!" I patted him on the shoulder said, "Thanks for stopping by." Then I opened up the door and said, "Take care guy!" He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt I laughed at first, then thought, "Hold up, that hurt!" It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real I said, "Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here." No further words and then I darted upstairs Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed Pulled the covers up over my head And said, "Oh please do somethin with Fred!" He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws Tried to get me, but my alarm went off And then silence! It was a whole new day I thought, "Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway." Until I noticed those rips in my sheets And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street FP:  Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff   Come on, come on   Come on Jeff, answer    Come on, man JJ:  Hello?

A lot of people may not have bought the last album Yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them to go out like that, our music is too def We produce hit records right and left Daytime, nighttime, def beat, def rhyme Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline All of this makes our records rock til the party's end.. .. here we go again! When we first came out, we had a smash hit song Then people started askin, "What's takin so long for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves?" I said, "Hold up - let me explain. When you hear a record on your radio station it's probably getting played all throughout the nation But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany France, Japan, Sweden London Italy So therefore, we had to go on tour City after city, 'Encore encore, bravo bravo!' Sorry we gotta go We got another show tomorrow night in Rio" The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know It takes a LONG TIME to travel the globe But now we gotta start this whole process all over again The last album was def, and here we go again! Special thanks, to everyone that helped us Without you, we would not have been able to sell as many records, we went top ten And got real and we'll do it again It was a long hard road, believe me People tryin to steal from me, and deceive me But that's cool, you live and learn my friends We did it before, and we'll do it agaim The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Album: He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper Song: Brand New Funk Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Fresh Prince] It's new, it's out of the ordinary It's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator have come together, and we made a musical composition which we think is a remedy to cure all the dance floors that's empty You wanna dance? We got what you want Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said, "What the...? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it" He just smiled and said, "Yeah def ain't it?" It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk} So we continued to listen to it And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette I took it home that night, and analyzed it Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up! You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin and clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, "Yo keep goin" So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands..} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat! * Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around! The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous music, that has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated But we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief This isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk! {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your hands..} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your hands..} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Album: He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper Song: Time to Chill Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Fresh Prince] For years I have been waitin and hesitatin to make a rap record, that had the pace of a slow song, quiet storm, chillin while the fire is warm You and your girl, with this record on your radio or stereo, I don't know I love you so is what you'll be sayin, while this record's playin You reminscin and kissin your girl Relax, lay back, unwind, cause now is time to chill Setting the mood, by the use of this groove is an ingenious, perceptive, brilliant, a very clever move Because the bassline, combined with the fresh rhyme at a slow tempo enticed passion to grow But if it's not passion, for which you search then use the song as a massage after a hard day's work And if it's true that music calms the savage beast Play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep Take a deep breath, stretch, kick off your footwear Put on the tape of this record, but beware Caution, warning, it's your decision There's nothin stronger that you can buy, without prescription It's soothing, somewhat hypnotic A rhythmic anesthetic it's practically a narcotic You want it? We got it -- come get it we're widdit Because it's all at the push of a button, yo Jeff, hit it! The objective, of this musical extravaganza is to enlighten you, stanza by stanza Verse after verse, have been precisely arranged Rearranged and then changed until the best remained The result being, this incredible song So for at least eight hours a day, you'll have this record on In the morning and at night in your room And all through the afternoon, you will be listening, mentally rapped up in the cut Some people will sit down and some will choose to get up But whatever you choose, just keep your ear to the wax Because we got somethin def that other rappers lack We haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is But it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids and teens and adults and senior citizens too And I'd be willing to bet, that it appeals to you, too! So if you're not into rap, give us a chance to change your mind, and to make you dance to this lyrical miracle, this musical discovery But yo I wanna chill for a second, yo Jeff, cover me It's like paradise, this music is nice It makes you hot if you want it too, or twice as cold as ice It brings love to the heart of a criminal With this subliminal power, all the women'll flock while all the guys rocks, when it's on your box It gained us a much bigger reputation than the White Sox You may ask yourself are we that famous? Bust this, the Queen of Spain knows what my real name is Our time is runnin short so I'll bid you farewell You know this cut is so def, that you have been overwhelmed Be cool, be chill, relax, have no fear.. ..

Charlie Mack is up front as we depart the hotel First we cause chaos throughout the city streets Then maybe stop at Burger King for a bite to eat And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face He's not a troublemaker, in fact, he's a troublebreaker And if somebody gets dumb, well it'll only take a second or two, after some fools snaps Law and order is restored by my hero Charlie Mack Wheel off into the limo, and head for the jam Charlie cracks all the knuckles, on both of his hands And when we pull up to the show, the routine is unrehearsed It's just natural that we let Charlie hop our first He clears the crowd without sayin a word Man, that's the loudest silence I've ever heard A lot of times guys test him, by tryin to bug He just, leaves ring imprints, all over their mugs He's a terminator, a Hercules of sorts Man to hell with chess, he likes physical sports You may not have known before but now you know the reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo [Fresh Prince] We'd like to apologize to all of our fans but please don't touch us when we're at our jams Cause Charlie don't like folks around us when we're doin a show And if he punches you, uh-oh, better get Maaco! Still you weak rap dudes tempers are hot just because I've got somethin that YOU AIN'T GOT If you want to get physical, rowdy or try to bomb me I won't get excited, I'll just say, "Yo Charlie!" You shoulda been kind, you shouldn't have snapped Charlie only hits you once and now you're takin a nap And when he leaves you decaptitated, crushed in the dust you'll look up, and see your girl in the limo with us You may think that's enough boy but I think not Charlie kick his face again I think you missed a spot I roll down the limo window and yell, "By the way Eyes you'll see your girl bucknaked givin Charlie a message" I'm serious, I'm not jokin, no doubt You know how many doubters bones have been broken You may not have known before but now you know the reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo [Fresh Prince] Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo He's Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo In closing, we'd like to say this, to you bustaz If you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up, plus kid embarassed and laughed at, by all of your friends And if you cross Charlie Mack it's the beginning of the end of life as you know it, you might not die, sir But if you're not dead, you'll wish you were But if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go You can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo  He's Charlie Mack and he's the first out the limo The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Album: He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper Song: As We Go Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {*Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches Slick Rick*  "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Fresh Prince] Now let's get this party, started off the right way Oww and HOE I think the crowd might say When we're on stage you know you can't resist {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} I'm the ultimate, and that's all I can say I sat down for about eight hours a day Tryin to figure out the proper description of ME and I came to the decision that there's no one syllable or phrase that can adequately describe this new craze But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see OK, I've got it, "All praise me!" Yup -- that's about the size of it I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it? But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} {*Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches Slick Rick*  "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Fresh Prince] It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly but I can't quite recall the time exactly but it was somewhere around, two or three or four oh forget it, let's just go on Anyway I stepped out of school Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease They started chantin my name, I said, "Ladies.. please!" I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz Grabbed on Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse Things were lookin good, I had plans for later on Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun Word! I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home Let me give him a call, on my car phone "Yo Jeff, what's shakin?" "Coolin, whassup?" "Girlies" "I'm with it, come pick me up!!!" I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's A whole carload of girlies and they ALL was def We walked into Jeff's and said, "Girls, you can't resist" {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} {*Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches Slick Rick*  "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Fresh]	Yo Jeff man, are you with me? {Jeff scratches..

I said, "I got a friend!" So the three of us left Went back to my crib, and gave a call to Jeff Five minutes later, Jeff walked in and I thought to myself, "Yeah, now the fun begins!" But the girls started buggin, and they said, "Now we want dinner in the best resteraunt in town We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight and Dom Perignon," I said, "Yeah right!" Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said, "Y'know I really think it's time for these ladies to go" We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed and it went a little {"somethin like this"} *door slams* But that was OK, that was alright cause we still had fun that night -- yaknowit! The moral of the story is plain and visible We always watch out for those kind of women but the past is the past and the present is the present And we feel that everyone should be sitting down {"so you all don't miss"} {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Doug E. beatboxing?] {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Doug E. beatboxing?] {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Doug E. beatboxing?] {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} [Doug E. beatboxing?] {"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Album: He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper Song: Parents Just Don't Understand Typed by: OHHLA.com You know parents are the same no matter time nor place They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes So to you, all the kids all across the land There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand I remember one year My mom took me school shopping It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister All hopped in the car We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose I didn't say nothing at first I just turned up my nose She said, "What's wrong? This shirt cost $20" I said, "Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!" The next half hour was the same old thing My mother buying me clothes from 1963 And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips! I said, "Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep" She said, "You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet" I said, "Mom, let's put these clothes back, please" She said "no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show" I said, "This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers But if you don't want to I can live with that but You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks" She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same Inevitably the first day of school came I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick But my mom said, "No, no way, uh-uh, forget it" There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought And those who weren't laughing still had a ball Because they were pointing and whispering As I walked down the hall I got home and told my Mom how my day went She said, "If they were laughing you don't need them, cause they're not good friends" For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times So to you all the kids all across the land There's no need to argue Parents just don't understand Oh-kay, here's the situation My parents went away on a week's vacation and They left the keys to the brand new Porsche Would they mind? Umm, well, of course not I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah, of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions I honked my horn just to get her attention She said, "Was that for me?" I said, "Yeah" She said, "Why?" I said, "Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy" She said, "How do I know you're not sick? You could be some deranged lunatic" I said, "C'mon toots - my name is the Prince = Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?" She agreed and we were on our way She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes She kicked her shoes off onto the floor She said, "Drive fast, speed turns me on" She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast The sun roof was open , the music was high And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche And to make this long story short - short When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell I said, "I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer" I almost had a heart attack that day Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway I was arrested, the car was impounded There was no way for me to avoid being grounded My parents had to come off from vacation to get me I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me My parents walked in I got my grip, I said, "Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?" They didn't speak - I said, "I want to plead my case" But my father just shoved me in the car by my face That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving I can't believe it, I just made a mistake Well parents are the same no matter time nor place So to you all the kids all across the land Take it from me, parents just don't understand The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Album: He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper Song: Pump Up the Bass Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Fresh Prince] In the place to be DJ Jazzy Jeff and yours truly the Fresh Prince Ay Jeff, do me a favor, give em just a lil' TOUCH of the bass Not a lot, just a lil' touch Jeff Word word Ay Jeff do me a favor man, Jazz it up Now bring it all back Yo man now break it down and let me go for mine When I first started out, Jeff used to come to my house Just as soon as school let out, he used to come to my crib, and you know what we did?

Oh no, I feel an attach comin on Yo Ready Rock C I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong! {Ready Rock does the entire intro and starts beatboxing after} [Fresh Prince] It used to be a problem this addiction I have I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark raving mad! Break into the arcade, screamin and hollerin Anticipatin puttin twenty-five dollars in any machine, I was out of control! I didn't need quarters I brought, $10 bank rolls Bags of quarters, I was insane People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change But I would get defensive and yell, "LEAVE ME ALONE! These are my quarters stupid, GO GET YOUR OWN!" Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like, "Yo man.. I wonder what's wrong with that guy?" I was addicted, a video burn-out and I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out the lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say, "Have a heart pal, one more game please?" Some nights I might sleep on the subway or outside of the arcade til it opened up the next day And when it opened at a quarter to ten it was the same old thing all over again I was doin bad, my future was bleek I'd rather play games than eat or sleep until one day, this guy came along He didn't have a radio but he was playin a song I got curious, so I said, "YO! What's that noise?" {What noise? I don't know!} "No fool, that noise you was makin there!" {What this?! *starts beatboxing*} "Yeahhhh!

Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song and I +LOST MY MIND+ when Ready C played Donkey Kong {Ready Rock does the intro, Kong shaking the beams,  the "How High Can You Go?" music, and the actual game sounds} Yo Ready, get funky with it! {Ready gets busy on the beatbox} Yo Jeff man what you doin? Give Ready a hand {Jazzy Jeff throws on another beat} Now my life is wonderful and I feel great I haven't been in an arcade since seventy-eight Thanks to Ready C I'm on an upward trail Because he's always by my side, he never fails me Whenever I have a video attack he's right there by my back, keepin me on track So if I bug out, and act like a lunatic he does Donkey Kong, and as soon as it gets to my eardrums, from his vocal chords I get hyped up! No matter how bored I am, he always comes through Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who Ready Rock C, here's a brief description of the things that he can do in his musical position Ready Rock C makes sounds with his mouth Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talkin about {Ready Rock beatboxes and then does Pac Man's death sound} 	{GAME OVER!} 	{Yo, Scrammy, why you still standin there?} 	{The game is over..

Song: Then She Bit Me  Typed by: Xdiamond7K@aol.com I was in a club, one Friday. A lovely Lady comes walking my way. She walked up and she said hello. I said hi, my names Joe. I was lyin', so was she. She said her name was Donna, But her shirt said Marie. Once you get to know me, you'll never forget me. I said why, then she bit me. Ouch! That didn't hurt. Kinda nicked me, but she ripped my shirt.  At that point I fell asleep. Woke up at her house, In the back of a jeep. A Blazer, '89 Tinted windows, I wish it was mine. Oh, it is, But where are my keys? There they are...in the ignition. I'm at her house. It's a Tepee. No, a skyscrapper. No, an igloo. No, it's a shack. Forget it, I'll go around back. It's a castle, with a moat How I get Across...Boat. (Twilight Zone noise) Shooo...I hate that sound. I went inside, Looked right, looked left. There she is. Oh, no Thats Jeff. He's invisible. I went downstairs. It's a loft. No, it's a dungeon! There she is, doing areobics. No, yoga. No, karate. *You killed my teacher!!!* But what a body! No, she wasn't there. I'm tellin you I saw her. No, really I saw her. She was playing checkers. No, Nintendo. Ok, I'm lying. There she is, Watching T.V. All My Children. No, thats Cosby. No, Speed Racer. No, thats Shaft. No, thats Kimble. My fault...the T.V.'s off. There she is, what a doll. No, that's Chucky from Child's play! I kissed her, And she told me this is home... I entered a dimension Called The Twilight Zone.... Where anything can happen. I'm rough like sandpaper, Hard like algebra. You should be glad that I was nice, And I allowed ya to Step on stage. To kick your ryhmes off. I tried to be nice, But you mistook that for softness. Now it's goin' to hell with your opinion! What I say goes fom now on, This is my dominion! Are there any rappers to step on stage Cause if you do You'll feel the force of my rage, I'm on a rampage!!!!!!! Syche just hit me. Jeff wanted to do that,  But I didn't. I thought that it would make the reccord dumb. I guess I wasn't wrong. Jack and Jill went up a hill,  To fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down, And broke his crown.... Hickory, dickory, dock. Got to use the bathroom now, Sike, I was drafted. The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince Album: And In This Corner...

( *drums and horns set in* ) 1-2-3-4 ( *Jazzy Jeff starts scratching* )  (Don't stop the rock) Now that's a record! Now that's a record! Go Jazzy, go Jazzy, go I want to be remembered for the songs that I sing Not only for the humor, but for the knowledge I bring To broaden the horizons of others is why I rap this Enlightening minds with my lyrical tactics In life everything ain't always what it seems But people are enchanted by things that gleam You know, bright fancy cars, big yachts and mansions On the beaches of Aruba with a girlie romancin Now I'm about to tell you a very artistic fable More fun than when you first got cable The moral to be learned from this story to be told Is that everything that glitters ain't always gold On July 11th I was sittin at home Talkin to my girlfriend Geena on the telephone Flippin through the newspaper checkin the news When I saw an advertisement for a Carribean cruise It said, 'Sunny skies and romantic nights On an incredible ship' - and I got hype It said it's like the _Love Boat_, baskin in the sun Promisin fun for you and for everyone I said, "That's dope! Baby, you're down?" She said, "Yeah, we could leave right now!" The very next day I put the check in the mail And one week later we were ready to sail The brochure said that the boat was large But it was nothin but a broken-down barnacle barge! And if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn'ta went Because the captain was a cross-eyed hunchback with a limp The cruise was paid for and the food was free So I said what the hell and set out to sea It didn't take long to notice something was wrong The ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it I didn't wanna panic, so I chilled for a while Till the captain pulled up to what we thought was a deserted isle We looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk We saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts! The said, "Hung-a-dung-a-digi-dung-da-doa" I said, "Hey baby, I guess that means get off the boat" Their chief said they needed a human sacrifice I said, "Well, just take my girl - he-he - syke" I was jokin, but things got serious Their leader came out and he was curious He got in my face and his breath was the worst I said, "Hey baby, you got some mints in your purse?" His breath was stinkin with filthy brown teeth And two big crusty ashy hairy feet The worst thing, he had no toenail on his toes And a big Teradactyl bird bone in his nose I tried to reason with him, he wasn't with it He said, "Tenga-shanko," that meant 'forget it' He said, "Gunga-shang-tang-da-bong-da-boo" That meant 'tonight we're having Fresh Prince stew' Then I saw it - no, it's not The big Indiana Jones people cooking pot! I wanted to fight em, but there was no way to beat em I thought to myself, 'Where's Tarzan when you need him?' Just as they were contemplatin cookin us up We had a major struck of luck, a Navy ship pulled up The troops came off and they got us out of the pot And I said to the chief, "Yo, I get witcha, hops!" The guy that rescued us said, "I hate to tell you The captain of your ship, he had just escaped from Belview We've been following him and finally we got him We're sorry, there's no way that you can possibly get a refund" A thousand dollars and a weekend island drained But a lesson well learned, so let me explain There's a very important message that needs to be told It's that everything that glitters ain't always gold The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince Album: And In This Corner...

Visa, Mastercard and even Discover She told me this is the way that I can show her I love her My friends tried talkin to me, they tried stoppin me (If she had a gun they'd arrest her for robbery!) I knew she was playin me for every dime But I loved when people said (Homes, your girl is fine) But then one day, yo, I got wise I found out she was messin with a couple of guys She told me that she loved me but I guess she forgot it Oh, you wanna play hardball, huh? (You got it) (You got it) [ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ] The final night that I caught this girlie I was out of town and I came home early I caught her in a club kissin some guy Fred Stormed up right behind her, grabbed her and I said "Yo Daliah! What's up, baby? Come on, you got to be crazy That's your cousin? You think I'm a nut? What kinda cousin would you let put his hand on your butt? Nah girl, you done got out of hand And it's about to seem like I'm the repo man You vacumed all of my funds like a rug But you stretched the cord too far, you pulled the plug Let's what? Come on, it's too late to talk It's like monopoly and I bought Cedar Boardwalk But tomorrow you'll wake up and talke a look And think the stockmarket crashed on your pocketbook But it's over, now I want everything All the way from Louis Vuiton bags to earrings Especially the solid gold earring noodles And the diamond watch, the whole kitten kaboodle Don't tell me I'm trippin Oh, you got amnesia now, you're forgettin Who did what for who, I gave my all to you I can't seem to see why you did wrong to me I finally figured out what you're about But it's the bottom of the night, two strikes and two outs You can go make a sucker of another fellow It's 12:01, let's give it up, Cinderella I ain't goin for it, stop cryin Like Ms. Melodie said: I ain't buyin it Game over, girl, you finished clockin You wanted your walking papers?

Song: The Girlie Had a Mustache Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch (Get down) [ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ] I was.. cruisin down the avenue, early one Friday When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way I turned my back to use my Binaca Blast And I said, "Hm-hm, excuse me," and she walked past She was about 5'6", or maybe six and a half With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad! Tight leather pants that fit like a drum And two big - yeah well, she had some Anyway from behind she was fine But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny But the laughter ceased when she said: "Hey honey!" At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy?! I tried to get away, I said, "Well, never mind Maybe I'll see you some other time" But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave And said, "Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans!" This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world My whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain They said, "Prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed" My pride was busted right along with my eye Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy And in retrospect I had to laugh I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache [ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ] I remember last year, the day was October 5th And my family went away on a weekend ski trip And they left $100 and a note by the phone That said: 'Don't have any company till we get home' No company? I'm 18! They must be jokin! And by 10 my crib was smokin All of my friends with their hands in the air Screamin (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!) The party was jammin till at least about 5 And as my friends were leaving, they were like "Homes, it was live!" I thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties I gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em I said, "Hi, my name's the Prince," they said, "Hi Prince, we're your harem" I didn't waste time, I started shootin the gift I said, "Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with" I walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture I said, "Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you? What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?" She turned around and smiled and laughed And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache Not four girls, four guys! They were in disguise, it was a set up all the time I made a complete fool of myself that day My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question "Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?" Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived I said, "What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!" "I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police" I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever My pop told me I was on punishment forever!

I remember my first car, never forget it A candy apple red I ROC, windows deep tinted Talk about fast like a rocket to drive Went from zero to 60 in like 5.5 Imagine red rims but that wasn't enough It had a car phone for when I wanted to reach out and touch An alpine stereo the straight up rock With 12" woofers you could hear for blocks The first day I got it I was frontin real hard I could hear people sayin (damn, look at that car) I was hyped and I wanted my friends to check it out So I went to the spot where they're usually hangin out Just my luck nobody's standin outside And I didn't really feel like parkin my ride So I honked my horn and nobody was comin I thougth what the heck, I went inside and left it runnin I was inside for 20 seconds that's all I found my friends, I said, "You gotta check this out, y'all" But when we came back out the car wasn't there (Man you ain't buy nothin) I did, I swear! My friends went inside, I was mad they didn't believe me Now i'm standin outside the spot my car used to be It's hard to figure out what to do all alone But then I got it: call the car phone (Fresh Prince's car?) Yo thief, bring my car back now Before I bust your (hold up wait a minute pal) (Seems like you forgot who's got the keys) I thought: he's right, "Well, bring it back, please" Hello Mr. Thief, don't hang up Aw then luckily Jeff pulled up I told him what had happened someone stole my car I said, "Come on Jeff, let's get him, he can't be far" We rode around for about 20 minutes And we were just about to say forget it When I spotted him, I said, "Jeff, go get it!" We pulled up behind him and man dude jetted He was drivin all wild and fast Like he was gettin points for the stuff that he crashed I called him on the car phone again and I said Of course you realize when I catch you you're dead All through Philly was a high speed chase and Dude was playin around like he thought we was racin 100 miles an hour and he lost control And slammed my car into a telephone pole I ran to the car said man you're okay He said yeah so I punched him in the face The cops came up as if it was my fault They saw me punch dude and charged me with assault If his neck was closer I probably woulda grabbed it He told the cops that I said he could have it I calmed down and they got things straight I saw half my car at 7th street the other half at 8th I wanted to just jump in the ocean My car looked like it was a Lego explosion Why does life have to be so hard?

Parties were all the same when we came up We had to rearrange and make a change I remember how it was, people standing still The music was wack, so they chose to get ill People started breaking and fights would start to break out This is the reason why some people make out Hip-hop to be bad, because of this behaviour Then like a miracle two musical saviours One with a microphone, the other with tables Both of em ready, both willing and able Bust on the scene like TNT People said, "Who can it be?" Can't you see it's Jeff and me We are praised as musical scholars Fast admiration manifestin dollars Couple of kids with a bright idea Didn't want a 9 to 5, made rap career People tried to dis and make the egos shrink But we believe in ourselves, so to hell what they think Moving like a freight train, can't be stopped Especially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box (I continued to rock while Jeff was on the beat box) Now cut it up, Jeff (Hip-hop) I know I talk about Jeff a whole hell of a lot But straight up, man, you gotta give him his props There's not many people that can do what he does Marley Marl, Teddy Riley and Hurby Luvbug But other than that there's not many around That can take that box and make it sound Like anything that you could possibly want Now here's a rhyme that sums it up Jeff is diggy-diggy-di-dope and You DJ's out there keep hopin His beat boxes will be broken But you might as well just keep hopin He ciri-can't be tizzaken You think he can, you're mistaken All records he is brizzeakin (Come on, man, you can make it) Grammy winning musicians His beat box is a-kizzickin And all my rhymes are hizzittin The album's out, so go get it There ain't no way we stizzopping We keep the parties rizzockin We got the crowd a-hip-hoppin When Jeff is on the beat box (I continued to rock while Jeff was on the beat box) One more time, scratch, Jeff (Hip-hop) Mh - let's see what's next on the agenda That's right, oh yeah, I've got it, I remember I was discussin how when Jeff's on stage He makes your hands clap, your feet tap, your eardrums pulsate Your body will move as you flow with the groove And you smile as he propiles his new rap tune When he's on the stage he can't be stopped 'specially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box (I continued to rock while Jeff was on the beat box) (Hip-hop) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince Album: Homebase Song: I'm All That Typed by: mack69daddy_@hotmail.com Spill the beans on the table I always say...

I can't get out Can't you see I'm trapped Can't you see I'm so confused I can't get out [Verse 2] Now your wondering lost in a jungle You came in hyped up but now your humble Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes You scream for help, blend in with the ??? and hoes You try to sit but their ain't know spaces The floor is a desert, a party oasis I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine You try to move no form of escape The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape Party's like a ??? Girls slim and trim on the floor Don't try to shoot for the door This ain't the gym The party goers every night had a scene This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus Aint a spiff or a spoof Boy you better not goof You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof The rhythm track from offside's to angles Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle You can't escape until the DJ's fingers up So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds You better jam we don't care if you hardcore Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor [Chorus 2x] [Verse 3] Me and prince got together just to kick our lines No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out You looking for the late AM this man pull red out Nobody cause killing is mean Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen Razzamatazz a pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh Soon as I worked through the door I got trapped on the dance floor See this girlie that I never saw She was looking raw Came a little closer Then I opposed her Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her ??? planes in the damn chain hard to explain I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train Listen as I discuss this yo bust this Like a hammer before me you cant touch this Trapped on the floor like a vulture Part of my culture You may even thought I was drived to faulter Get live like a ???jack that fives you the window main???

Agent F.P. get on the case immediately [Jeff] Lets, Lets Go [Fresh Prince] I Got the call about eleven fifteen Twelve o'clock arrived on the scene Looked around and things were ill The party was at a dead stand still People sittin' around no music The situation was somewhat confusing But I'm a detective I knew right away what happened Somebody stole the D.J. Who or why I had no clue But I knew what I had to do No eat no sleep, just work Then walked past this fly mini-skirt I had to dis her quick before she greeted Come on baby I'm working, beat it Come on I'm busy, just go away Gotta find out who stole the D.J. [Jeff] Lets, Lets Go [Fresh Prince] This mystery needed to quickly be solved Cause there were kids involved Friday and Saturday nights had no songs Why, because the D.J. was gone Smiles you used to dance and sing around Now were replaced by frowns And it was up to me to solve the mystery And get back the disc jockey I found an eye witness But his breath wreaked of chitlins All I know is his breath did pound Buddy forget it, just write it down No fingerprints no clues The only witness was the bad breath dude It was up to me to save the day And find out who stole the D.J. [Jeff] Lets, Lets Go [Fresh Prince] Through the door this dame walked in I swear to James Bond a perfect ten I thought to myself I'm working just forget it Then I thought well maybe I've got a minute So I took her down to the station To the back room for some interrogation Captain doesn't like it, but I must confess I interrogate best when I'm undressed We were in there for hours drained To see who would break first, me or the dame Then she broke, and her mind was my possession (Prince I love you) That wasn't the question I only wanna know one thing I've gotta make the kids dance and sing So tell me now cause crime don't pay baby Who stole the D.J. I scarrowed the city but still no clue Lost like a cause, what should I do Then like a bolt of ligtening it hit me Ah, the worst villain in the city I wasn't prepared for what was in store He had stolen the D.J. before You all know this ruthless foe To his hideout (let, lets go) Tip toed up the steps Slowly and ever so quietly I crept But out of nowhere I was attacked Just like in the movies, clubbed from the back I felt like a fool (man, you need to go back to private eye school) I was the dunce of the day There I was tied up with the D.J. [Jeff] Let's Go [Fresh Prince] There we were both tied to a pole I told the D.J. relax its under control (Relax man, we both goin' down you can't even keep yourself untied) Do you want to be free or not I'm gonna get us out of this tight spot I planned this all along cap There a knife in my swiss army hat With the blade I cut the rope (Man your secret services spy hats dope) I radio'd for back up cars So we could put this crook behind bars Another criminal off the streets Another D.J. back to his beats I walked in the club and I was happy to say Ladies and gentlemen, here's your D.J. [Jeff] Let's Go [Announcer] Calling all cars, calling all cars Be on the lookout, (let, lets go) Someone has stolen another D.J.

Come on [Will Smith] When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day) I'd earned the cream that make the rocks gleam Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates Writing lines, seal fates Power to change the whole set For exposure or forfeit And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence Envisioned a hot life, hot wife Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas With lights simmer trees for the ambiance I been up and down and high and low Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley It's something that my fam put in me Who am I? You ask The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life Boom stitched up by my wife Who am I? It's suffice to say found gold in my heart Put the ice away Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day Who am I? That brother with the platinum plaque With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack The fact is that when that brother rap or act Hold position, front of the pack Who am I?

It ain't hard to tell Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell See a lot know my face but a few know me well Just who I am is the one to make you gel Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin' Taking back all my snip that was bitten Rewritten dangerous laison With the shades on Making sure the track stays on Days on end I'll be that one true friend That will always be around when the world falls down I'm honest to the bone No question, suggestion You don't wanna know I give the truth, nothing less than I'm sweet with a heart to fit Smart as a whip You feed me well but I'm still hard to get I'm like a calculus problem you just can't solve Study me well if you wanna get involved And even after that I'm still unpredictable Now who am I?

Color of the mountains Colossal as the earth Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind Here I stand before you, the color of the night Frozen by the potential of me (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) An Afro Angel Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin for love In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations Hopin he with new hit single, is tryin to mingle Today, he is in your town, puttin it down You in the car with your friends, followin my limo around Puttin a bug in my boy's ear, your "S" is for free You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm As all your girlfriends getting jealous, damn she landed the bomb Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage Something small, something simple as a pass back stage But now I lay me, down to creep And I - pray the Lord my soul to keep Chorus: Afro Angel, born against the world You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride Afro Angel, sent from heaven above Never forget that you are loved You know that you are loved Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems Rage inside, pride, been denied respect He can't take it though he gotta earn it But he ain't learned that yet Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before But now he straps, and no more Attitude high Flexin on every guy that walk by But don't start pal Cuz if the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now Let's pull it on a stranger Ahh, fun for the crew Surprised when he realized, damn dude got one too Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute Bobby's a deer in a headlights Pump, drop it or I'll shoot Then like a sniper, cleanin his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands One shot rings out (gunshot) then only the stranger stands Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings But for what? Chorus: Afro Angel, born against the world You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride Afro Angel, sent from heaven above Never forget that you are loved You know that you are loved Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game But had the cutest kid you ever seen Then all the pressure from her mom She stepped to Russ Told him it's either them drugs or us Either them thugs or us The ultimatum, either continue bein a thug in the world Or start lovin your girl And say God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin ya dear But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year That ain't happenin I guess he wasn't that strong He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone Yo they straight moved away, without as little as a word Well, needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone Upstate Schenectady, Tamika answered the door It was the last person she expected to be They just stared He said you love me for me? You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry? Down with me? Period. Through life's stress and strife She said, Yeah, He said in that case Would you please be my wife? Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried Like an angel sings I love y'all more than anything Chorus: Afro Angel, born against the world You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride Afro Angel, sent from heaven above Never forget that you are loved You know that you are loved (Repeat Chorus) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Will Smith f/ Jazzie Jeff, Biz Markie, Slick Rick Album: Willenium Song: So Fresh Typed by: brians@compusmart.ab.ca (let's listen to this dramatic show which was popular in the early days of radio) [Will Smith] Ha ha, unh, yeah yeah Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh Little taste of the old school Jazzy Jeff, yo, break it down one time Say what?

Willennium Song: The Rain Typed by: brians@compusmart.ab.ca [Chorus: Jill Scott] The little rain drops fallin' down on me But I can't seem to feel it, feel it Feel it coming over me [Will Smith] The rain gon' come through the window, pain will come Black, white, rich, poor, it's the same old drum Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin' Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain >From the wetness, they stand to gain I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder My time to shine, did it like summer I wondered if the sun would shine forever Pops said "rain gon' come", to him I said "never" Chedder in the genes, face on screens Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin' Platinumn, grammys, famous, but still broke and Not having cash put me in check Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself Ever since then, the rain I never felt Deal wit' it [Will Smith] At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurrcaine Her first name still conjuers the rain Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet Lest we forget, love is a four season concept Many say the rain they can't stand Never let the weather determine the man God has a plan, from it I never ran Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand I'm Noah, life's my arc forty days and forty nights, still can't take my heart Seen the fallen man To dope and liquor brands The devil'll dance to make it rain Bringing the pain Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt Since then, the rain I never felt  What's wit' it [Will Smith] Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds See kids in the streets, runnin' around It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down I wondered how, with my mouth wide Reminisce of the key, said I wanna go outside In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me 'Bout that time, God started rappin' to me He said "pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow  So the seeds of joy might grow Don't be afraid, find shelter in me The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity" I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem These little children, the world we must receive like them I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He delt And since then, the rain I never felt What's wit' it The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Will Smith Album: Born to Reign Song: Born to Reign

righteous, fighting for life This my life, and that's why I go to my vices Tighten the vices of truth, on the roofless They rhymin', the crime is, just useless The path of the poison, the Genesis of the gentle side You and your boys, tryin' to decide What to write, but your pen is a sword And the blade has been forged, young minds gettin' gorged States have been altered, by labor, by weed And then hate gets exalted, as art falls to grieve Choices is made, as the voices is laid On the track, contract, ya souls the wage, sold ya wage Did you see his new Benz, but your like a syringe Now a part of you ???, gotta lot of new friends, gotta lot of new ends Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts at the pen Giving false accounts, of your accounts amounts Amounts of fans tweezing, stands to reason Since your inception, laced with deception And ??? false affection, it must parish From a terrace, I see the fire burning the streets But I won't shield my eyes to the heat Born to

He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred! He wears the same hat and sweater every single day And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway! He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street! [Fresh Prince] It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right And we had just gotten back off tour last night So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies I got Angie, Jeff got Tina Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life That was all right because the lady was chill Then we dipped to the theater set to ill Buggin! Cold havin a ball and somethin bout Elm Street was the movie we saw The way it started was decent, ya know nothing real fancy bout this guy named Fred and this girl named Nancy But word, when it was over, I said, "Yo! That was def!" And everything seemed all right when we left But when I got home and laid down to sleep That began the nightmare, but on my street! [Fresh Prince] It was burnin in my room like an oven My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30 It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty I wanted something cool, to quench my thirst I thought to myself, "Yo, this heat is the worst!" But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong I was home all alone but the TV was on!  I thought nothin of it as I grabbed the remote I pushed the power button, and then I almost choked When I heard this awful voice comin from behind It said, "You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!" Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was Broke outside my drawers and screamed, "So long, cuz!" Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin Then thought, "Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin" I strolled back home with a grin on my grill I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince But Freddy killed all that noise real quick He grabbed me by my neck and said, "Here's what we'll do. We gotta lotta work here, me and you. The souls of your friends you and I will claim. You've got the body, and I've got the brain." I said, "Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong. I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long! Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work. The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!" Fred got mad and his head started steamin But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin I said, "Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep; or gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week." I patted him on the shoulder said, "Thanks for stopping by." Then I opened up the door and said, "Take care guy!" He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt I laughed at first, then thought, "Hold up, that hurt!" It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real I said, "Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here." No further words and then I darted upstairs Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed Pulled the covers up over my head And said, "Oh please do somethin with Fred!" He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws Tried to get me, but my alarm went off And then silence! It was a whole new day I thought, "Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway." Until I noticed those rips in my sheets And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street FP:  Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff   Come on, come on   Come on Jeff, answer    Come on, man JJ:  Hello?

Verse 2 I hate to see you cry, tear after tear while this guy Plays you like your life is a game I've seen his type and there all the same Breaking your heart without a care Girl if I was in you shoes he'd be outta there Your man is wak good for nothin' but flack I'd tell him to pack and hit the road Jack Who loves ya baby I do you know He doesn't care about you let him go Where he at now? You don't know Layin' up under some whole double waste Just let me chill, no need for me to get ill Cause yo I'm the best and yo time will tell But I'll be here so ring my bell Chorus Verse 3 Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale But this ain't no children's book I'm here, for you to take me dear Just open your eyes and look at what the future holds for you And if you lunch then you might ruin Something great don't make a big mistake Pay attention to what you're doing Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs It's sort of a mission Now you're on a rocky road But you could get up just make that decision That you want the one to love adore you and hold you and treat you well So when you're ready to be treated that way Baby you can ring my bell Chorus (Repeat till fade) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Album: Greatest Hits Song: The Things That U Do (Hula Radio Remix) * Typed by: 5snelgr1@cheyne.kent.sch.uk * Original mix appears on the album _Homebase_ Intro/Chorus It's just the things that you do (5x) The way you do the things you do Verse 1 8:05 the alarm clock sounds I grab my shoes and turn the damn thing down But now it's 9 o clock I still ain't up yet Work on time, yeah I admire the concept You got me yearnin' and I'm anticipating Seeing you I can't wait it's hard to concentrate My mind is blind from all the time thinking of you And the way you do the things you do Chorus I walk in the park for a midnight rendezvous A slow dance, romance, promoted for see through I wanna be with you And I ain't hidin' it A wave of love and I'm gliding and riding it Things like that when you hear me say Sort of sounds like that same old clich Climb the highest mountain swim the deepest sea But I can't front, I want you to want me Cause baby when you grab me tightly You send chills that tend to incite me When you caress and fondle me lightly Ah girl watch out cause you might be Setting yourself up the way that you tease me Cause sooner or later you're gonna have to please me It's just somethin' about you The way you do the things you do Chorus Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me Be chasing one lady It's just somethin' about you The way you carry yourself when you're out to Seem to have a captivating style, I've parked the feelin' But your whip is appealing And since this is a subject I bought up I might as well just admit that I'm caught up It ain't the clothes you're wearing Your perfume or the style that your hair's in It ain't your body or how slim your waist is Your new jeans or how pretty your face is But I feel funny when in close proximity Making me wonder what's gettin' into me There's just somethin' about you The way you do the things you do Chorus Bridge It's the things that you do (2x) The way you do the things you do Verse 4 The mystery's solved this girl I ponder Just sitting back letting my mind wonder What da, why da, who da, how da hell does this young lady Drive me so crazy Deeply in thought pose like a thinker I blow you a kiss or a wink or a smile just to show There's somethin' about you The way you do the things you do The way you do the things you do Chorus (Repeat till fade) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Will Smith Album: Men in Black soundtrack Song: Just Cruisin' Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Will Smith] Intro, the maestro, nice flow Hot like nitro.. cool as ice though That type of dichotomy, y'all know it's gotta be  Who else could it be BUT me?

He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back (Ya heard me!)
