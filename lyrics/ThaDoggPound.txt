Typed by: jdjong@worldonline.nl Snoop (Daz): Yeah, what I'ma do right here is take my time, and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace, and my niggas behind the wall. See you when I get there, you know what I'm saying? (really doe) So drip with me as I go down memory lane. Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener, (1-8-7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, ('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). I bring you the motherfucking .38, (just get the MC and the homie Nate). So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). Nate (Daz): Do you remember back on the East Side? Where all us niggas used to love to ride. We didn't care what we did, time was nothing to us we were just kids. Times are different now, but you still get stuck, I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. Snoop: Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, June 17th, 1979. That's my first time being arrested, I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit.  I learned than from the G's, a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, she said: "playing football should be your only fun son". I'm like "allright" so we enter the house, come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, I looked at my momma and said: "damn, why you snitch?" They put me on punishment but that didn't work, now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. Nate: My homie told me one day he had a jack move, he said: "come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth". I agreed and said "come on, let's go and jack them fools", next day we were draped in the county blues. I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), saying to myself "I'll never fuck with that nigga again". 'fore I'm locked down I learned to be what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. Original gangsta Daz: I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, to let you know we can't take no more. Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, and ask myself: "who the fuck should I really fear?". I ran around with the best killers, thug criminals and drug dealers. Blasting niggas if they come near us, (???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. Knock on wood for good luck, serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. Nate (Daz): Original gangsta (original gangsta), coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). Coming from the East Side... You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, C-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, shout outs to my niggas C, Style and me. Snoop (Nate): Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) You trick ass bitch!

Child support papers? What? Chorus: You didn't have to file on me, you turned my child on me. Why you had to file on me? You turned my child on me. Daz: As I lay myself to sleep at night, I pray the lord my soul to keep, so I can try to do right. There's no one else that I can turn to, I'm asking a favor, oh just once, Oh Jesus Christ, lord I'm asking you. Gave to this world a young baby, know one life is crazy, promise to live the righteous life of the path of my babies. Watch the clouds spread, and it shades my heart, My relationship fell apart. Don't know where it ended, sure can tell you just how it started, she filed child support, and it's really cold hearted. I've been taking care of you and your kid, all of my life, mad at me 'cause I wouldn't make you my wife. I've done a lot of crazy things in my days, killing to get that weapon named, robbing just to get paid. Now how much more can I bear, and I explode inside, still asking myself why... chorus "Lil" C-Style: I'm like "what, child support?", man, who ever thought I would get filed on. Uh, you know what I'm saying? Do gangsters get filed on child support? Hell yeah they do. I got filed on, I ain't the only one out the crew. Uh, child support, have I got something for 'em, uh? I, I, I, I walk by faith, and not by sight, living day by day, praying night after night. 'Cause I'm seeing so much, so much lust lust lust, and every pretty girl I see, I wanna touch touch touch. You think I'm doing too much or what?  I'm dating the preacher's daughter, and getting the toe up. And every time she drinks she gets drunk and throws up, if I'm on the spot, you know she's surfing on my (??). Look in her best, from the back bend over, now she's eight months, got me buying me baby clothes, and I stroll up. Writing her lawyer, talking 'bout how much I owe her, wrote him back, "I can't do a damn thing for ya". All I can do, is just take care of my daughter, thirty days later I got a court order. She filed on me, cold game, she filed on me, uh. chorus Daz: Now I'm sitting in court as she's trying to get everything, from my house and my cars to my gold rings. Trying to drain a brother just like dreino, you know the same old situation's occurred, got me sitting on the curbs, smoking a bomb joint, trying to pull my point. Every night I get the marihuana, thinking it would take away the pain, waking up the next morning, and thing are still the same. Big C-Style: I did so much, to get so little. Paid more than the court even asked of me. But loving no more, not even a parlay? And you want me to pay? It's not like it's for my baby, it's more like for you and your nigga. Why you have to lie on me, and turn my child on me. chorus (3 times) The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Daz Dillinger f/ Lady 'V', Big Pimpin Album: Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back Song: Only For U Typed by: jdjong@worldonline.nl Daz: You know what I'm saying?

This life is hard, treats you cold, plus life don't last, and plus we're dying fast and plus these fools is blasting. Yo grace is what I'm asking for, It's no chilling when that man in black is at my door. I thought I'd seen him a couple of times before, ran back the other way, took off course and forced to cherish the day.

Any second we can meet you, lifestyles of earth mislead you. Have mercy on my soul, please lay me down easy, God watches, and he knows the life we live ain't easy. At least try to live right, 'cause life ain't long, and ain't nothing like living life all day long. Mister Bad is all good like the songs we sing, I simply gotta thank god for the life I live. Daz: You never know what's going on in this world, thank god I'm just still in this world. We're in the streets everyday, that's where we live, we was thaught to perceive and to give. Don't be stingy, give a little 'cause I do, don't be fake and be yourself to stay true. When you see me in the streets oh get me, don't play hate and dump at me. Don't be sad homie, only be happy.

the globe, sunshine is no It's kind of crazy in these streets Where killers will grab the heat Nigga listen to the shit that I speak Y'all know the outcome, from Filmore to Third It's crucial on every turf They ride and skird off Until the next day they plot and let the gats burst off I've seen it with my own eyes A witness to this sick life Where niggas will kill to flip some vice Or a Vette, Viper, or Lex to floss around the West Shit I'm nothin' nice so out on these streets keep a vest [Verse 2] I'd rather ball than be on these streets hustlin' for mine It's dirty out here so I'm only trustin' the nine And I'm knownin' this money ain't worth my freedom My homie caught a case back in 88 and ever since I ain't seen him I live the life of crime, affiliated in this dangerous times

you ballin' or either broke If ya stay in the drama might live or get smoked Cause it's fifty-fifty, laugh now cry later And funkin' is for keeps and they comin' back with the sprayer [Verse 4] It

all the beef All the creep when the money get took It's on the book, ain't no comeback when O's get cooked They say who done that, the mystery Hoes involved who tried to ball Who caught the shot in the pen and made em' take a fall This a no-brainers, seeds get planted and they blossom Big smiles and hugs niggas they playin' possum Grimey ones, scope niggas for all they shiney ones Comin' out they glove or they jacket with a tiny gun Frontin' for some project hoes Playas keep ya jewels tucked when ya come through scuff Niggas snitches [Chorus x2] [Verse 3] It's snitches everywhere I look from Alabama to the West Keepin' Tha Commissiona stressed for scrilla Stuck for the rest of ya life nigga Livin' the rest of ya life misunderstood Not knowin' ya friend is ya foe I seen it before in

can't cope Take the whole world for a joke And at the end of ya rope I spooted you many times on blocks sellin' dope I done hoped and bubbled on top, richer than Bob Hope Takin' a leave when I see it in ya eyes As you approach in a doja cloud Tryin' to hustle up for a smoke Nigga you should be ashamed the way ya usin' ya name Puttin' black eyes in the game You should be out of the game Nigga it's snitches everywhere I look ain't shit changed [Verse 4] Now feel the motherfuckin' vibe as I burst the flames They on this shit worldwide The whole world was tight on slang Sell rhymes like the undergrounds of caine When I'm deliverin' pain, fatal lyrics to ya brain I will train ya mind and design ya with sights to see the real No appeals, you in the world with lots to live for real I feel it'll probably be a thrill, with a couple of mill With a Lex on twenty inch chets for me to wheel But I'd rather have a couple of mill Break the fam straight and leave em' with a spot in the hills The deal is sealed Still I hustle hard cause the cash is straight Complete the album, gon' let the streets blast the tape Stashed away, I no they phony ass will hate But that's great cause niggas that's

Do families turn there backs over emotions or acts? Turn their back over emotional acts? Do they fall in emotional traps? Do it transpire into emotional collapse? From nickel's and mac's, over bread and bitches, poetics and rap's Or who they choose to do business with or perhaps, we talkin bout family I can't believe my eyes, it's the stand up, fall and rise All cuz how cuz I'm fuckin with Blood Oh this niggas hot cuz I'm fuckin with cuz Oh this nigga got problems because of this He read an article and thought a nigga tried to dis When we was young we use to roll like a all nighter  Then roll a pimp game kicked in and popped collars Me and one of my brothers use to be the tightest group Until this motherfuckin day, we the tighest group I can't help it if a nigga make a sudden change Would it be a different game if it wasn't change? Would we be as close as we was in '93? I can't help but think a little bit differently I can't help but think we might even be closer We use to be back to back holdin toasters [Chorus: Kurupt] I didn't change..

Every man lookin at each other, scared to blink The seed inside the sanctuary, scary Portraits of Saint Mary, with Mona Lisa The Queen of Cheeba, strokin a cheetah Other mid-wives sayin 'I don't like the way he treats her' Pass the reefer, bass cheeba, Solomon judge wisely Wisdom spoken of highly, hair knotty, ask God 'Why me?'
