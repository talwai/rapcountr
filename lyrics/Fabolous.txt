Blige in '92 But I pray I would find you They say weather the storm and leave the gray skies behind you The fake may try to blind you That's why I stay fly like I do And no I can't trust everybody that I say "Hi" and "Bye" to First I need a girl that may die as my boo Then I may try the "I Do's", but I refuse to be tricked or used by a chick who get amusement and kicks out abusing my dick When it's real I'm all in it But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it Before it didn't matter who Now I look for some with a little attitude I could chill to chatter to, good looking but witty and compatible Long hair with a fatty too, and that'll do [Hook: Lil' Mo] No I'm not trying to pressure you But my loves too incredible, far too great, (right in front of your face) And I'll give you something you can feel To let you know that I really need somebody real [Fabolous] I need to holla at somebody real, could that be you The feelings that I feel, could that be true Most cats lay where the hood rats beat boo But I'm the kinda cat that strays away That's till somebody real sways my way Then I might spend some days away, on an Asia Bay Eatin' food made the Cajun way, and sippin' a little sake Boilin' a little broccoli But this world is full of floozies that bullshit usually I pull them choosy Cuz on this joint, and at this point I know I have to holla at somebody real, for real [Chorus] - repeat to fade The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Fabolous Album: Real Talk Song: It's All Right Typed by: CivicOnSum18s@aol.com * * send corrections to the typist [INTRO: (SEAN PAUL)] All you need to know is the vibe round' here we built and instill it Sean Paul alongside Fabolous...You done know we buss'...

She said "that can be arranged" And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged We did, she slid, that'd a be explained But for now she hopped into a Platinum-colored Range [Trey Songz] See baby, see you gotta get ur mind right while there's still time left You know life, wanting VIP sections and flight confirmations Jumpin start to star, got ur own constellation I aint tryna say dat u, shit, maybe I am Never follow ur heart Sure to lose your mindif u neva follow ur heart..
