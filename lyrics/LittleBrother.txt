She ain't care She said, "For tonight I just wanna be your insignificant other." Huh, what? God damn! [Verse Two] Oh we left the club at around two Just enough time to meet my niggas for round two At another spot, DJ playing the sounds too  Hopefully divert me from being a scoundrel  In the spot making my rounds through The crowd trying to throw her off  But she's on me like a bloodhound Jew Wouldn’t believe how hard I tried to fight it Passions and desires were closin' in And that’s what it amounts to I looked her in the eyes And say, "I don’t even know your name It feels wrong even though I don’t show it." She said, "I wish I could tell you the same But I won't tell you my name  Cause I want you to fuck me like you don’t know it." I responded with a smirk  To let her know we can work  No matter what time or day of the week it is So thorough, that backstage girl  Fell down to her knees just to pray on my weaknesses Maaaan can you fight her? Go head You'd think the backstage would be the last place you'd find her  You'd think the backstage would be the last place you'd find her Been ridin' all around the world Seen so many faces But I'm always lookin' for love in all the wrong places Been ridin' all around the world, seen so many faces Backstage girl But I'm always lookin' for love in all the wrong places [Phonte talking] I woke up the next morning all tangled up in her hair  That's when I realized she had me all where she wanted me She told me I'd taken her to places she'd never been before But really she took me to a place I promised myself I'd never return to And I was fucked up  And the thing was I didn't feel bad about what I've done I just felt stupid for trying to fight it for so long I mean really who I was fooling? I knew what time it was soon as I saw her Soon as she smiled at a nigga I could tell what the favorite position was And I damn sure gave it to her I thought I had changed But niggas never changes But it took that one night That one passionate night for me to realize what I needed to do I gotta stop fucking with these hoes off of Myspace dawg Some say she was from Cali Some say the Carolinas Mom was a belly dancer Pap' was a never minder No drugs or alcohol No weed or marijuana You'd think the backstage was the last place you'd find her The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: DJ Spinna f/ Phonte (Little Brother) Album: www.RappersIKnow.com Song: Dillagence Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com [Phonte - singing throughout the song] One won't do, two is not enough for me - NO...

It'll balance out in the end Maybe it's the day I cursed my momma in my teenage years But my daughter did the same, so that's a clean slate yeah?

I'll just be open, I've broken a few hearts But Karma, I've seen my own one broken in two parts I ain't tryna cop pleas, but loan me a new start I guess I'm waisting my time just knowing who you are, you're Karma [Phonte] Uh, Phontigga, Kam, let's go Yo, hello Karma, it's Phontigga begging your pardon I'm sorry, don't mean to be bothering But I can tell you're following my moves and for all the shit I did, I should be going to hell on scholarship So let's talk it out a bit, let's sit down and do some bargaining like reasonable adults and keep it moderate Surely you won't take me out my gang They say you a bitch but I won't call you out your name Even the road to hell gets off to a good start So please understand that your boy got a good heart Just tryna live his life, coaching kids on Saturday morning to make up for what he do on Friday nights That's how you know a nigga living right When he ain't gotta butter up, all in the hopes that it cover up the fact that a nigga living trife I begged Karma, she said "Nigga, you kidding right?" That's when she spoke to me I swear and my heart rate went through the roof She said "I figured by now you knew the scoop Silly nigga, I done told your ass, you might be through with your past But your past ain't through with you So don't be scared of them guns when they shoot off Times get tight and you can't get your loot off Either way I'm coming back to kick you in your ass But maybe if you lucky, I just might take my boot off", Karma [Ayah] I told you once, told you twice But you wasn't doing any right Yeah-eah.. yeah {*Outro skit plays for 1:00*} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Keelay & Zaire f/ DMinor, Phonte Album: Ridin' High Song: Alright With Me Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com [DMinor] The look, in your eyes tells me more than any word could ever do But still, still you try To my surprise you make all this feel so brand new When I touch your skin I feel it Girl, it takes me to the ceiling No one since had made me feel the way you do When I dream you're always in it Every second every minute I'll insert the perfect specimen in you [Chorus: DMinor] See cause I don't need to, ask my people You're alright with me Don't care how they see me, proud to be together, you and me [DMinor] Now I know, what you think Don't be mad cause every word I've said is true People say what they don't mean like it's impossible to want you like I do When you're near I'm so excited So damn much, I just can't hide it When we kiss, it's like the first time that we do So electric when I feel it I don't want, I can't conceal it From here on out I see a future love with you [Phonte] Yeah, uh huh, I'ma talk to 'em Check it out, uh Love her down, lick her up Tigga just can't get enough This groove, please don't interrupt Don't pause at the mall People looking like "Damn, how that nigga get with her?"

You seem a little lonely, maybe you could use some talkin' to. Might want me to put my arm on you Or else one of these off brand K-Mart niggas might try to Target you." That's when she started laughin' So then I started askin' "Why don't you get a real nigga with a heart of passion? That ain't scared to spit it at you in a harder fashion. You flyin' high right now, but you ain't far from crashin'." She pulled me close and licked her lips to talk to me She said, "On the real, what you did was lovely.  And, you a lot different than these jigs that follow me.  Here's a big apology, cause I dig your honesty. But, I'm to myself and I ain't tryin' to change that. I got a girlfriend who's panties remain wet." I said, "What made you change to the same sex?" She said, "Fuckin' with that gutta nigga named Spec!" (Owww!) C'mon [Chorus] [Phonte] The who the what the where the when the why Reasons I should leave you Sometimes wifey but never my spouse So many reasons, but I can't even call 'em all out The who the what the where the when the why I, I, I Wantin' to leave instead of waitin' you out So many reasons and that's exactly what I'm about [Outro] [Phonte talking] C'mon Spec. C'mon man. You look like, youknowhatimsayin'?  That nigga, he look like he a good nigga. Youknowhatimsayin'? Hoes they see the dreads and shit youknowhatimsayin'? They like, "Yo this a righteous, positive nigga." Man, fuck all that Man, that nigga be feelin' them bitches out. Word up I've seen it happen. It's not a pretty thing "Yeah, what's up baby?
