So I begin to fill his dish with Kibbles N' Bits Let him in so he can eat, and I'm eating my shit So now we both full and well fed Happier than that fat rat Templeton from Charlotte's Web And now its time to get our walk on Izzy can get his bark on It's a beautiful day maybe we'll get our state park on I know the lake is at its finest (you better take afvantage) I'll grab my backpack, this leash, and maybe make a sandwich I better grab my ghetto blaster and a few tapes A thurmos full of water and a bag of fresh grapes Some more tapes cause you know that music comes first And what's a little Jackson Five gonna hurt?

Put yourself in my situation Try to be humble, you won't refrain from getting' pissed When you look down to see you're fallin' right through time's abyss And start to see visions memories you really miss, simple things Like your first birthday wish Your first girlfriend Your first love Your first French kiss Your first time feeling hate The first time you got dissed Your first day of school Your very first college class Your first time touchin' titties First time you got ass Your first time learnin' wrong from right First lonely night The first time you got your ass whooped in Your first real fight Your first triple-double dare Your first pubic hair Your first time watchin' Jason Your first nightmare That's when you realize that time was your worst nightmare And now you're stuck asking yourself 'Why ain't life fair?' You get closer to the bottom, see the end of your line Your first time ever losin' this battle with time But right before you meet your death, one more memory left The only one that's obsolete was your first breath One moon to the next Clocks switch when you least expect it and make the simplest shit complex The baby face got the planet fooled Books get judged by the covers worldwide, coincide with the illest The real is just fictional dreams No time to deal with two dimensional fiends, shit hit's the fan with every click of a hand I'll be a man eventually When the kid in me is satisfied, but 'til the day arrives all I got is eighty-five. A clock can kill motivation that's why I'm never rockin' a watch What's a deadline when you're living on your own time? I'm livin' slow, Peter Pan style son You didn't know I never grow up my mind is set at six years old As far as I'm concerned this grown-up shit is for the birds So pass the skittles, JuJu Fruits, the Now N Laters, and Nerds I'm eatin' sweets until my teeth fall out and I can't see And I'm deaf in my left ear but my right can hear cause I'm livin' happily.

I'm really mommy's little angel But that angel on my shoulder got strangled For trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong day And got cut like DJs spinning doubles (let the fucking song play) I'm on my way to the store ignoring the city To purchase a pack of Marb' Reds with a stack of rolled pennies I could go for Denny's, and my stomach holds plenty But my pockets got holes, I guess the goal is to stay empty Quite simply put: me and my pockets share interest I'll never fall in love with that pretty green-eyed temptress, twice (yeah right) I learned my lesson the first time I just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparel Parallel to many clones, my eye's vision monochromes With seven shades and twenty tones Plus I breath artistic, they eating everything I'm feeding them Put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium And results of my children, we share the same genes Cast the same reflection and interpret the same dreams Like whoa, like whoa, like whoa.. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.. (Chorus) And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose) Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless) But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine Content with the fact that I know this city's mine And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose) Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless) But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine Content with the fact that I know this city's mine (Verse 2) I walk down dead end streets like I didn't see the sign Just to turn around and walk back That's fine and dandy, but what's whack is the fact I'm still walking Like "Thank God for walkmans." I'm only yawning cause these simply minded mortals make me sleepy So what do I do? I resort to T.V In the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself with lackluster images And insignificant information like "Willis was really Ty Bridges" Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversations And for lack of better stimulation I'm painting portraits of dysfunctional families with gloomy faces Rockin' "Don't Worry, Be Happy" t-shirts, and you're assuming I'm tasteless? You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it The basic essentials of a very bitter young man That kicks rusty soda cans and walks on decrepit bricks With a permanent pair of headphones trying to make these lectures stick I'll let the protestors picket, like they are gonna make a difference And watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent Like their cause was nonexistent.. (Chorus) And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose) Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless) But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine Content with the fact that I know this city's mine And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose) Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless) But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine Content with the fact that I know this city's mine (Verse 3) I walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose My purpose got defeated when my mind turned paraplegic Plus I failed my civil service exam, they said I cheated Not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-grader More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson Hence the ridilin, I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one (one) I stepped on the left cause right's wrong (wrong) So what do I do? I resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song in "Sixpence" I'm "None the Richer", I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking (Chorus) And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose) Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless) But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine Content with the fact that I know this city's mine And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose) Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless) But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine Content with the fact that I know this city's mine The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Gym Class Heroes Album: The Papercut Chronicles Song: Makeout Club Typed by: apnoynamedroy@yahoo.com If I recall correctly It was the middle of spring Walkin with my boys Contemplating what summer will bring We started talkin about girls And it was the funniest thing As I started remembering some of my funniest flings See there was ashley She caught my eye the very second that she passed me I kissed her once Then she started to harass me She called all night long I had to buy a brand new phone And let me see There was Melanie To have a mouth like that should be a felony Wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin me I mean dirty vocab She used to talk like she was grown And after that there was tiffany The one with the cute cousin Are you kiddin' me?

Like "God, why in the fuck I had to be born this way?" God would reply, "Son you gotta show 'em you're more than gay" (Gotta show 'em you're more than gay..) See he had dreams to be a track star Until the warm April night them gay jokes went way too far Ronnie begged for his forgiveness and invited him to a party Cause his parents went away and left him plenty of Bacardi Alberto kindly accepted, he was finally accepted Except it was all deception and left him all unprotected It was a plan Ronnie had scammed to get him in the right place Verbally degrade him and rearrange his pretty face The plan would go swiftly, they started callin him sissy One punch turned into fifty they beat him till he was dizzy Now Alberto lie in blood while his peers look on in fear He took his last breath and passed away his senior year Needless to say it was one big tragedy And how was Ronnie gonna explain it to his family While they were on vacation takin in sights He got wasted and killed a kid that night [Chorus: repeat 4X] Don't be a slave and behave the way they do Just utilize the gifts that God gave you [Verse Two] I knew this girl named Maria, bright and talented With aspirations to be a, big superstar What a great idea, until she fell off and started to listenin to her peers - oh dear! Now Maria was your typical obnoxious analytical Headstrong rebel flippin off the principal Single mother home structure, she looked after baby brother While moms worked two jobs just to buy supper Pops was a strugglin musician, troubled man Jugglin family and heroin addiction He overdosed and left a notice of eviction And, a crate of records on the table in the kitchen And, a little angel with a keen sense of sound Who saw silence in the records she found And she would stay up late at night Recitin songs to herself under pale moonlight Rightin wrongs that her pops made Promised her mom she would never go that same route, turns out Carrie Anne had other plans Her and her man Ronnie most popular, second best to nobody Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling And the story ends the same way Okay Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days And told him no drinkin - what the fuck was they thinkin? Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited So when Carrie Anne asked, she got all excited Like "Damn, now I got somethin to look forward to" Or so she thought Maria kindly accepted, she was finally accepted Except it was all bullshit, now pay attention Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing So she scored a bag of heroin, but the craziest thing Was Maria never touched drugs, she did that night And when her man was gettin beat she was nowhere in sight Now her boyfriend lie in blood and she had no idea Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year Needless to say it was one big tragedy And, I hate to break it but it doesn't end happily A warm day in May, the sky was so beautiful Carrie Anne died in a crash leavin the funeral The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Gym Class Heroes Album: The Papercut Chronicles Song: Wejustfreestylin' Pt. 2 Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash [Intro conversation to open] If he were recording If he were recording right now Then he would be getting all this at the start My track - yo we should have a freestyle on this Freestyle?

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for three days (rephrase) If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face But all I got is this Powerbook and "Ichat" Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back I stay on my feet (shit) And be persistent until my name is under "who you'd like to meet" Who cares if we don't know each other's last name All I know is that I'm smittin with your pictures wishin you would feel the same I'll admit I get a lil jealous when other dudes leave you comments Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense Make me out, romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought But it's all wishful thinking Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin you out And if you love then what I'm speaking about, then say something I check my inbox 10 times and there ain't nothing You probably busy doing something sexy I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be So yeah its time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry This is madness, xoxo dash Travis The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Gym Class Heroes Album: As Cruel as School Children Song: Clothes Off Typed by: notgnirracnwahsar@yahoo.com * * send corrections to the typist We have to take off those clothes We have to party all night  We have to take off those clothes To have a good time [Verse 1] Excuse me miss I couldn't help to notice how alone you are I dig your attitude and how your actin how you own the bar Got me flashin keys and I don't even own a car Frontin like you ain't feelin my charm because I know you are I'm trin see how your lips feel Im sorry my names Travis and I'm pretty much a big deal Oh, you never heard of me, hmmmm That sounds absurd to me The way you stole my attention is flat out burglary What do you say we exit stage left so me and you could possible be in a place with naked peek-a-boo cause After all you blouse your wearing is kind of see through And its obvious I'm battin where ever your leader needs too Such an angel with a devilish angle and aquite the certified sweet talker And your buying every line of it girl And I don't even blame you If I was in your shoes I'll probably do the same too [Verse 2] Now here's another barn burner for all the slow learners Put your helmet on and take a seat on the short bus Next stop, right around the corner from your moma nem No turning back so you better buckle up Shit, don't be concern with mine I be like a speaker spell the way I got you learnin my lines fine Pull the string replay that shit I change my name to did he really just say that shit  Yeap I take her by if you let me 6'5 200 pluss so sexy My legs going numb for keepin my phone on viberate Hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin me And I have trying to never mind it man But every time I get a new number she finds it Dam And you thought you had it sewn up Until right around   clock when I shown up [Chorus: repeat 2X] We got chicks Its all hot chicks Any block chicks and Hip Hop chicks Thin chick round chicks Black white yellow and brown chicks [Verse 3] Good grief girl your giving me goose bumps Standin there in your underwear and new pumps Its like the more time we waste the less time I get to tast you Honestly I can easily replace you Its not a scam girl Its how I am girl Peter Pan I'm a sucker for smuther jam girl Its clear I'm only here for good clean fun Shut up and kiss me like the inter lumps under my tongue [Chorus: repeat 2X] We got chicks Its all hot chicks Any block chicks and Hip Hop chicks Thin chick round chicks Black white yellow and brown chicks The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Gym Class Heroes Album: As Cruel as School Children Song: Sloppy Love Jingle, Pt. 1 Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash ROLL SLOPPY LOVE JINGLE SEQUENCE ONE ACTION!!! {*noisy background with a lot of people*} [Travie McCoy] Bartender!

Actually, will you... will you send a drink to the lady at the end of the bar? Yeah that one right there  Here you are miss Yeah, yeah - it's on me, tell her it's from Travie  It's from this guy over here From the second she shimmied in I was intrigued by her essence And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt Simple and plain I'm probably jumpin the train But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt Hit the pause button - damn!! I don't even know this girl And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothings But that's a classic trait of a soft-spoken, heart-broken, fellow like my self best believe  Pussy! I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve But that night - the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up Wait a minute, hold up I think she caught me grillin, now I'm spillin my drink I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink The only problem is, I'm not your ordinary average Romeo A Cyrano de Bergerac  Man shut the fuck up! In fact - I remember back in fifth grade I tried to read the book of love but sadly The introduction didn't grab me So I left it on the shelf and kept moving Assuming that this planet rotates I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate Who woulda thunk I'd be pissy-ass drunk when time came for collision? So I made the decision to just keep my composure  Cool, cool Until she started gettin closer And then I felt this weird feeling underneath my left shoulder Then I - slipped, tripped, busted my lip and fell in love The minute that she stepped through the door The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mixtapes for To me she, equalled MC squared and everything else was mathematics I never took the time to practice The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Gym Class Heroes Album: As Cruel as School Children Song: Viva La White Girl Typed by: sensative_new_age_guy@hotmail.com [Intro] (Fame, fourtune, platinum records It's evey boys dream...)

Hmm, maybe I should crack a joke Attack and ask her if she smokes Cause I can't seem to find my matches And that could break the ice but I'm a bad actress with three lighters I acquired the previous night And there I was, do or die She was approximately five feet away from my frame So I decided to take it in stride, swallow my pride Tellin her my name like "Hello miss, my name is Travis Just a ordinary cat, I'm into art and fuzzy rabbits Kinda smart with a big heart, and you can have it! I see you find that funny I'd love to buy you a drink but I got bent and spent my money But would you kindly accept a raincheck? Perhaps some deep chit chat?" She didn't think twice nodded her head and said "I'm with that" (AWESOME!) "By the way you got some matches?" She's like "No, but there's a lighter right in front of you" (Stupid, stupid, stupid!)

I was drunk and I admit I LOVED it, every last second I couldn't kill that thought of us butt-ass naked Telly surfin with the fan on Chattin about the session and Slowly get into some closet skeleton confessions That's when, she made an offer that I couldn't refuse And chills when up and down my legs like Samoan tattoos She said she had a pad that wasn't too far away And said she love it if I stayed 'til the following day So it was time to exit stage left I made my rounds, gave my pounds and hugs Gathered my thoughts and took a deep breath {*INHALES*} And now we walkin to the door but Right before we stepped outside she bought me one more ("Yo good lookin out son!") And now I'm feelin it I had my hand in my pocket but she stealin it With our fingers interlocked and as we're walkin down Exchange Street with our hearts pitter-pattin to the same beat And then she popped the question like "Trav, you ever been in love?"

H G, C, H Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music? Well this is your big chance You see, music is much like a brocaded butterfly with a shadowy promenade of effervescence yet sloops down the bottom of misty mountains of darkness Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror God, what is this opaque window of comfort that we cannot overcome? It is a manifestation of gluttony It a forest of emptiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul thieves who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners But it is only when your soul is taken away that you can take it back And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever or does it?

Then she gave me a look, so unchristian and told she'd pray for my children I said "If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?" Maybe I would be a fool to think that somewhere in the sky's a place for me What good would it be to pray for me? You won't save me, don't pray for me [Travie McCoy] Now I've never been religious I'm just a big fan of logistics And if it makes sense then I'm all for it I even pray if the situation calls for it Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles I try to answer without soundin satirical I'm three years past my expiration and yet I'm still fresher than a newborn So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say I've never seen a unicorn And I never chase rainbows But I heard the devil wears designer clothes So does God have a favorite brand? And for that matter, is he even a man? And will I go to Hell for even sayin that?
