Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone Meaning if it rains, I'm the one it's raining on When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone Places we get flown Parties that we've thrown I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown I'm just in my zone I call this shit the calm, Yeah But I'm the furthest thing from calm Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause... [Talking] You know, everything gone be alright, I promise Apologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but... 40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness" You know, so... Forgive me. Yeah [Verse 2] Uh, And life is so insane Look what I've became Tryna make a name All my first dates are interrupted by my fame Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain It's a curse you gotta live with when you're born to entertain Women need attention therefore women will complain Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in Miami at the game I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin' So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain Hopin' Western Union doing currency exchange Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change Damn, and I could only feel his pain Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once again He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain Ohio girl heart is in a slang Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame As a man I'm just honest As a artist I'm a king With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain Yea, And see this is the thang What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane Is the single handed reason I remain... Me, yeah [Talking] Uh, I said I call this shit the calm. But I'm the furthest thing from calm. I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like...

of just chillin is gone and uh Loves lost Loves gone Love lost Love is gone Check And nowadays some girls are the type of person that Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin Since I ain't made them a purchase yet but theres logic behind it emotions double and they try to cover up Like a mansion with the projects behind it I tend to freak with this I get a girl and pretend that I love the spendin And all she gave was a decent kiss Thinkin she been spoiled but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days And come up with tin foil We could dissect it see you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing gave her nothing her reputations in jeopardy Cause it ain't take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me Instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me For thinkin that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong nowadays most of the

[Verse 1] I met this new girl late june or early july I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied Now it's december, I'm driving, and she's like where's my hi? I swear, that I never called you cause I really get shy See that was a segue, I believe the matter Is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter Where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up Drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up Where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing And if you planning family vacations you better know when But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos Where cancun college students pouring water on their titties! [Talking: over Chorus] Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one But just wait, nah mean, take it slow [Verse 2] Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach She lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get the suite She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat I love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat" Off this I'm kinda takin it back for a second I get her number she tells me to call her after this session And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached I'm thinkin off I should've been more southern And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho! [Talking: over Chorus] Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right uh, ya man, it's what it is [Verse 3] And now, I'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench She love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench She tellin everyone imma hold here down Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town And stupid me I just listen to her, Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round But then spring shows up, and it's dallas in this bitch The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed When we were together it seeming like way back when Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime [Voice + (Drake)] I miss you, most of aaaallll, myy daarling [Beat fades out] (gimme a second to gather my toughts) [fades back in] strolling in the park (ho!)
