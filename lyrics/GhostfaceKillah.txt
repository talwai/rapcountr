I ... I ... I ... [Verse 1: Ghostface Killah] Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller This about a young boy dealing with the older fellas Promised him the lives you see on TV He ran packs across town like rhyme CD's And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks Stacking too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box Saving, he promised his mom a crib in Atlanta And his pops got killed in debt, he was a gambler So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases No more cross-town, now he's crossing them states and Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust So when the door kicked open they scream "This is a bust" "Is it a set up?", it seems funny, a scuffle broke out He got hit, dropped the cases spitting blood out of his mouth He walked four blocks to die trying to survive And now all that's left is his mom screaming "God Why?"

Let my begin by saying I don't think this man knew what he had in store He opened the door and found the bag under the floor Not a peep, always working a lot, get the flame, aim, pop Open the box and take off out the back of the pawn shop Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car He felt like he been hustling so hard like a demon he pumped a cold heart Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart, put the rings on his chain attached by both parts He did the drop, one ring in a bag, envelope, all the money he had Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail In the box was a bullet made of gold Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band And he stared at it sitting in the palm of his hand And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand It was his wife in the picture on his side With the ring on the finger on the week that she died As he looked in the reflection, at those eyes so red He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head Like that [Chorus:Lupe Fiasco] Uh, spraypaint and ink pens I use to write in every color I think in To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I ...

I'm going through this difficult stage, I find it hard to believe Why my old earth had so many seeds But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV Rockin each other's pants to school wasn't easy We survived winters, snotty nose with no coats We kept it real but the older brothers still had jokes Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six I didn't know nothin but mommy neatly packed his shit She cried, and grandma held the family down I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down Check it, fifteen of us in a three-bedroom apartment Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there Four on the bed, two at the foot, two at the head I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon, he peed the bed Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box We shared the same spoon watchin Saturday cartoons Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel And there were days I had to go to Tex house with a note Stating "Gloria can I borrow some food? I'm dead broke" So embarrassin, I couldn't stand to knock on they door My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps at stores Mommy, where's the toilet paper? Usually newspaper Look, Ms. Rose gave us a couch She's the neighbor Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me But I remember this, moms would lick her finger tips To wipe the coal out my eye before school wit her spit Case worker had her runnin back to face the face I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyse the sky And ask myself was I meant to be here?...
