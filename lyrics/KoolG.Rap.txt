The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kool G Rap and DJ Polo Album: Road to the Riches Song: Road to the Riches Typed by: jostmatt@bgb.ch [Verse One] When I was five years old I realized there was a road At the end I will win lots of pots of gold Never took a break, never made a mistake Took time to create cause there's money to make To be a billionaire takes hard work for years Some nights I shedded tears while I sent up prayers Been through hard times, even worked part time in a Key Food store sweepin floors for dimes I was sort of a porter takin the next man's order Breakin my back for a shack from headquarters All my manpower for four bucks an hour Took the time, I wrote rhymes in the shower Shoes are scoffed cos the road gets rough But I'ma rock it til my pockets ain't stuffed enough All the freaks wouldn't speak cos my checks was weak They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek A way to get a play, and maybe one day I'll be performin up a storm for a decent pay No matter how it seems I always kept the dream All the girlies scream and suckas get creamed Dreamed about it for five years straight Finally I got a break and cut my first plate The road ain't yellow and there ain't no witches My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches [Verse Two] I used to stand on the block sellin cooked up rock Money bustin out my sock cos I really would clock They were for kind of fiends bringin jackets and jeans Magazines, anything, just to hustle for beans The cash was comin fast, money grew like grass People hungry for the blast that don't even last Didn't want to be involved but the money will getcha Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture But I still supplied, some people I knew died Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide Money, jewelry, livin like a star And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino I shot up stores and I kicked down doors Collecting scars from little neighborhood wars Many legs I broke, many necks I choked And if provoked I let the pistol smoke Loyal members in a crew now down with the game Sellin nickels and dimes, sunshine or rain What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad In the first time in my life loanin money to dad Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches [Verse Three] A thug a-mugs for drugs, he eventually bugs Lookin for crack on carpets and rugs The squealers tells but the dealer still sells Little spoiled kids inheritin oil wells I was the type on the opposite side Of smokin the pipe, in a beef I got hype Cos rags to riches switches men to witches Become stitches, body bags in ditches Bloodshed, I painted the town red People fled as I put a dread's head to bed That mean's dead, in other words deceased Face got erased, bullets got released Bombs were planted, the kids were kidnapped In fact that was a way to get back At enemies who tried to clock G's on my block, now they forever knock Z's Plans of rampages went for ages Some got knocked and locked inside cages Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts In God We Trust, now rots to rust Plus caps to cops, policeman drops You blew off his top when the pistol went pop Troopers, soldiers, rollin like boulders Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder Some young male put in jail His lawyer so good his bail is on sale Lookin at the hourglass, how long can this power last? Longer than my song but he already fell He likes to eat hardy, party Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes And than a-wait and wait and wait Til he breaks, that's all it takes So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand On his own two feet because now he's in a new land Rules are different and so is life When you think with a shank, talk with a knife Not my lifestyle so I made a U-turn More money I earn, more money to burn Pushin all buttons, pullin all switches My name is G.

Yo that's her job, Sonya's mommy is a bar stripper Drug dealers drive around looking hard Knowing they're sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard Every day is a main event, some old lady limps The pushers and pimps eat shrimps It gets tiring, the sight of a gun firing They must desire for the sound of a siren A bag lady dies in an alleyway She's seen the last of her days inside the subways More and more down the slope, the kid couldn't cope So he stole somebody's dope and a gold rope Now my son's on the run, he's a wanted one Had fun then was done by a shotgun Upstairs I cover my ears and tears The man downstairs must have drank too many beers Cause every day of his life he beats his wife Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife Blind man plays the sax A tune called “The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks” Many lives are cut short That's when you're living In the streets of New York Baby needs new shoes But his papa uses all the money for booze A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a Caddy Calling some man Daddy Three men slain inside an apartment All you could see was the sparks when it darkened Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene The drug war, daily routine Gambling spots, just a poor man's jackpot You winning a lot, you get shot The drug dealing fanatics But you don't want no static Cause they got crack addicts with automatics Shoot-outs for a desire for territory A kid got caught in the crossfire A tired mother can't take no more She grab the bottle full of sleeping pills and took about 24 Human beings are laying on the pavement Cause they're a part of a mental enslavement The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers This type of life is making you hyper People scouting a torched-out building And got killed when the cold air filled in Is hell really suggested? No more persons arrested, a child molested A little kid says, "Yo I got a color TV, CD player and car stereo And all I want is a castle I also got a .38, don't give me no hassle" One kid heads straight for the top And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop Look behind you when you walk That's how it is in the streets of New York The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kool G Rap & DJ Polo Album: Wanted: Dead or Alive Song: Wanted: Dead or Alive Typed by: furness@ousd.k12.ca.us I'm wanted dead or alive I stalk the New York sidewalk All the girls hawk, but I don't stop to talk I keep stepping with a nine on my waistline Got 16 shots and I don't waste mine Never fess cause I'm dressed with a bulletproof vest Try to test, I leave a bloody-ass mess Driving a Saab that connects with the mob Bank job, plenty niggers I rob Blood stains are on my Ballys A sucker got rowdy, so I shot him in an alley Pumped his face full of dum-dums Then left him for the cast of rats and the bums Yo a lot of suckers hate me with a passion Cause they know I can catch them one night and I ain't flashing I got a crazy big posse or should I say a crew?

So what the heck, you select my dialect. Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject. Cuz I could use a technique, smart as an antique. Beats that I repeat show you that I can speak totally, probably, you rappers wanna copy me. It takes strategy just like Monopoly.

Even the jewelry on the hands He slapped the bitch up, and she cried, and begged him not to take her wedding band Now everybody's in shock, and I'm walking past the scared ass passengers with the nine millimeter cocked Lookin for who was next And sittin by the pole was a old ass man wearin a Rolex I took the shit and hit the bastard hard Ripped his pants clean off his ass and got the Visa and the MasterCard My little man said, "A-yo check this," he pointed at this bitch who looked rich, wearin a long pearl necklace Word to God, she got my dick hard, and that was the truth So I drug her ass inside the conductor's booth As the hoe started to shout, I threw her on her knees and made her freeze and put my dick inside her pretty mouth All of the sudden I just, nutted Pulled up my pants and zipped up She's on the floor with her mouth flooded Came back out with the iron *gun shot* The next motherfucker to move, is dyin!

"Now get the fuck out the car!" Slammed the bitch down on the tar, now she needs CPR but I don't give a fuck, I just jetted My man said set it, two more detectives got wetted As we raced down the block Lettin off a whole lot of shots and didn't stop Police gave us a chase, a blue and white rage My shorty got grazed in the face Another cop tried to let off, I put another clip in my shit and blew his motherfuckin head off Stomped my foot on the gas pedal Sparks are flyin and shit, from the bullets hittin the car metal So now we just runnin The shorties and me G, one of the three gunmen Side by side we're on the highway, and lettin off shots The three outlaws, against the cops It's like a fuckin adventure About four cops got dropped, three motherfuckers got injured The last of the cop cars pressed up My man aimed the joint, the hollow points tore his fuckin vest up I put a slug inside the tire They ran into a tall-ass wall, now it's great balls of fire So now we got away clean, yeah Smilin like a motherfucker countin the green You can't fuck with the kid My boy started thinkin back on the train bout all that shit we did Leavin niggaz in poverty Three black motherfuckers pulled off a great train robbery Took all those motherfuckers ducats But hey, what I can say, life is a bitch so FUCK IT The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kool G.

I see mine and then attack it Please, doctor please, put me in a straight jacket The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kool G Rap and DJ Polo Album: Live and Let Die Song: Ill Street Blues Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com Aw yeah, word up, word to mother.

Since I made the record "Talk Like Sex,"  bitches are comin' up with their friends for a nigga to hit the skins. Hopin' the Kool G Rap was just makin' rhymes, but I'm leavin' bitches' vaginas with more stitches than Frankenstein. Some even had the nerve to try to give me head, and swallow the whole jimmy to make a nigga fed. But come on you bitches, don't make me laugh; you couldn't deep throat G Rap if you was a motherfuckin' giraffe. Dag, some even fled when they saw the head, cuz G's dick would make you seasick fuckin' me in a waterbed. Don't try to paly me like no sucker, cuz these bitches'll be callin' up Dial-a-Mattress like a motherfucker. You heard the song before; you don't wanna see me, "I'll fuck you on the A-train while I write graffiti." I'll even fuck you in a taxi cab, and after sex with a nigga you'll be buyin' a box of maxi-pads. Soon as you open your legs, no need for no birth control, bitch, cuz my dick is touchin' the eggs. Kool G Rap, the pussy slammer; hell, I'd be talkin' fucked up grammar if you was Bad Mamma Jamma. I ain't small, I'll have you cummin' like waterfalls, and then turn them sugar walls into Carnegie Hall. Leavin' my mark on bitches like Zorro, plus fuckin' bitches so def like there won't be no pussy left tomorrow. Hittin' hoes like it ain't funny, I think about bowls of Cheerios because I want my nuts and honey. Talkin' to all the women that look fine, pretendin' my prick was Moby Dick and have a whale of a time. Now I'm not a deep-sea diver, but I love it when my dick's covered and smothered with saliva. Shit, might even straighten out your dentures, because it's not just a blow job, honey, it's an adventure. But 69, and I ain't with that: I'll go to a Chinese restaurant, bitch, if I wanna eat cats. Because you gotta be brave to eat the tuna, G. So when it comes to pussy-lickin', I'm the chicken of the sea. I should be on the sex channel; not a chump cuz I'm givin' punk-bitches better humps than camels. If you're a virgin, I'll make it fit, because my dick'll pop the cherry and spit out the fuckin' pit. And if you're concerned, my sperm don't burn, and if it did, I'd give that nappy-headed ass a fuckin' perm. Shucks, I instruct a fuckin' lesson. You think it's painless? I hit the anus and fuck up your large intestines. Leavin' you bitches stingin' from the bangin'; my man Jimmy got a hole in his head, but yo, that nigga's still hangin'. Bitch, you'd rather hump a fuckin' whole army, cuz even the Witness Protection Program couldn't hide this man's salami. You fuck around and catch a seizure, before I fuck a hoe I gots ta put the hooker under anesthesia. Lettin' saliva dribble on your nipple, orgasms double and triple sit ripple and turn your ass into a gripple. Then I see you searchin' for the swellin', cuz I'm-a leave a hole so big your gynecologist might fall the hell in. Got damn! I hit the ham right; honeybuns, you can ask my Three Sons, I got the Dick right out the Van Dyke. I'm fuckin' naked girls with fly rhymes, but don't push me, because that pussy will be runnin' for it's nine lives. I know you hookers can't refuse this, but dont' pick me to give no hickeys cuz I'm givin' bitches bruises. Yeah, I'll tear that pussy hole apart, for fuckin' with G Rap after dark, you'd rather jog in Central Park. So if you want kids before I fuck ya, look at the size of my dick, and you'll let out the motherfuckers. Shit, bitches get open like a can; just leave it up to G Rap, cuz I'm the neighborhood Fuck U Man... The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kool G.

"Rated XXX" Big girls try to squash me, but I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me, Hit the sack cause I ain't jokin', cause when I start pumpin' shit up, I leave it smokin', So ya betta hold on tight all right, cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite, A stick, a trick, and it kills her, i'm probably related to Long Dong Silver, But it gets gooder and gooder, every time I grab a hooka and I put her on my frankfurter, Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip, cause the only thing I'm lickin' is your ass with a whip, And it's a real freaky scene, i'm hittin' girls with their heads in a guillotine, Why certainly I'm squirtin', bust your nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain, Pushin' your head to the pillow, and givin' more pleasure than a double-headed dildo, A big ass gives me a hard-on, but I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton, Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety, i'll fuck you on the "A" train while I write graffiti, In a restaurant, takin' you straight to heaven, in a cab or the back of 7-11, Whether you're white and the music you like is rock, you can come and get some hip-hop cock, Consider this dick on your clitoris, but never try to flex, cause I'ma talk like sex. The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kool G Rap and DJ Polo Album: Wanted: Dead or Alive Song: Jive Talk A letter to you suckers, each and every one of you duck mothafuckers, your girl puckers her lips so I stuck her. You're gellin' me, yo, so what the hell you tellin' me? Now I'm-a show you fuckin' with me is a felony. I'm crushin. Tell you suckers to start hushin'. Shush, no discussion, cuz I'm-a start rushin'. The payback, and I attack the pack that's wack. The black mack: brown like a Cracker Jack. Slick and quick. I got pick a bic to stick,  to kick some shit, chicks I dick with. The One. Give up the fun with the gun, my son. I don't run, I kick mothafuckers done. It don't matter, I make niggas scatter, teeth start to chatter, your head I'm-a splatter. Arraigned. Breakin' to maintain and watchin' my name bring you pain. I'm standin' on your blood stain. Hard to hold. I'm bold, I roll real cold. Too much soul, dick made of gold. I rolled niggas to hell; you tried to swell but fell. Now get well or die like a dry cell. A rap villain. Chillin' and i don't give a fuck about a killin' cuz I'm still in effect when you're illin'. A terrorist. I terrorize like an assassin. Yes, I'm trespassin', your ass I'm harassin', huh. Talk is cheap. I'm keepin' ya six feet deep, so don't sleep when I creep, you'll leap like athletes. Slammin'. Examine what I'm jammin'. Hey, I don't play -- I burn like a gamma ray. Labeled prey, played to pave the way. Mothafuckers are scared straight...   [Interlude for shout outs, leading to a freestyle-like verse] Check this out... The creature feature, searcher, preacher, teacher, taught to rough the cap to rap to ya and reach ya. Musical master, mind reacts as a brain that has the  knowledge is answered. You're just a Kit Kat, on some Tic-Tacs, but I'm a Big Mac, cuz I'm G Rap. Fully equipped with a hip hop lip, my memory bank is like a microchip. My bass will give a shake, or if not quake, it'll make you, sucker MC, wanna jump in the lake. Cuz I'm murder, homi-cide, color. Must kill and destroy with excitement and drama. Weakest, I'll seek her, you become weaker. My art is the smoke, my materials and media. So rap alert for ya, devastate the area.  I'll give a grain of your...lyrical mania. Power source, and a G enforced, your headboards, and they could be rap wars. So come one or two, 'cept for a few. Doubles and couples -- and I'll grip 'em like tools. Cuz boy, you can't handles this, none or any, one or many, some or plenty. Cuz I'm not the stranger, just the rhyme arranger. Highly explosive, keep out, danger. Packin' Gs while you try to beat me, but for these MCs who go on and wannabe Gs. What I write is in a smoking section; here's an injection of rap perfection. So what the heck, you select my dialect. Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject. Cuz I could use a technique, smart as an antique. Beats that I repeat show you that I can speak totally, probably, you rappers wanna copy me. It takes strategy just like Monopoly. Figure it out:  Kool G Rap is about makin' armies and crews look like Girl Scouts. Cuz when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'. Suckers taht be yappin' won't think that this'll happen... (Yo MCs, all wannabe Kanes and Chuck Ds, skeeze, Fs, Gs, Rock Shantes, Ks, L-M-N-O-Ps hit the backs of my reeds, facsimilies. Freeze...catch the wave, later; rappers got the alphabet but I'm an Alpha Beta Kappa...rappers, they form my alumni step to this if you're prejudiced... PEACE!)

This is poison so be alert and cautious Those who act courageous you will get nauseous Infected or contaminated Turn on your stereo never come radio-activated Deadly and fatal, poison the title My recital hits the parts that are vital So tune in the tone of beats and poems Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones Pull out your Q-tips, clean out the earwax If you're still hard of hearing, I'mma scrub them with Ajax With maximum drum so behave and remember You're a slave to my sound wave Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find A new method time after time Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then Put it on paper cause I make you hyper Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper Like cherries or some say berries Mandatory for the auditory and its glory Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me G speaks in a new technique of fury Domination of drums and noise and Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison Poison! (x3) Look-alikes on the mic you should get off You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get rid of, cause you bit off Bite off ate off imitate off They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup Male or female shut them up, Po shut her up Yeah hide my line as you pick them up Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as well have said stick them up Letters of metaphor matters to better the fatter your pocket Rhymes blast off like rockets Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass Made in a minute the sky is the limit  For reaching the goal and the dream wouldn't you want to be in it to win it? Biters are wanted like animals hunted Soon as I get them I hit them I done it to the suckers who fronted The rappers who made it and did it Forget about winning the battle cause I'mma shake rattle and roll A little something for girls and boys and Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time One step beyond and not behind the line That separates dogs from divine Take it as a caution, or a warning sign Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's With Polo and while he's slicing I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson My brain is like a factory constantly creating Material stitch by stitch for decoration Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining My passion in rhyming is fashion designing Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show And my brain glows just like a rainbow Rappers and poets they already know it G Rap is a terror not a error and never will I stop reaching for better Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel  G Rap will make you feel the real deal I usually rap hardcore and I know That y'all thinking am I somehow semi, so We yell "party" and girls and boys and Remember Kool G Rap, Doc the Butcher and Polo is poison Artist: Kool G.

You know I miss you"	"Whassup?"

I gave his ass a book of matches (Hey!) I couldn't even get a rap Without this little motherfucker jumpin his ass into my bitch's lap I started rubbin on her curves But I'm mad because this little brat is gettin on my nerves I pulled the bitch up by her hair		"What's the matter baby?" "Aiyyo, whydon'tcha get rid of little man?"	"Alright baby" She took me to a room that was dark	"Hey, come in here" I was undressin on the way to get a head start And then I let the door shut Lifted up her skirt and started feelin on the whore's butt Suckin on her titties like candy Five minutes later had her comin in her panties Now she's ready for the dick "Yo you ready bitch?" (mmm-hmm) "Well first, take a lick!" Down on her knees is where she dropped Suckin on and suckin on and suckin on my cock Bust that nut, that's what I'm hopin Then yo, all of a sudden, the door flew wide open What the hell is this about? *child crying* She jumped up in a flash and took my dick out of her mouth Yeah, the little nigga's throwin a fit Talkin about he's hungry and shit "Wait a minute baby, let me get up so I can feed him" But I felt like takin off my belt and beat him He already gave my leg a cut Now the little bastard is fuckin up my nut She, didn't even get the lead off So I picked up one of his Ninja Turtle dolls and pulled the head off (Hey whatchu doin?) Yeah motherfucker now we even Forty-five minute passed, the bitch ain't back, fuckit I'm leavin I got dressed, and put my hat back on my head (Hey!) "Later bitch,"		"No wait baby" "Drop dead!"

Since I made the record "Talk Like Sex,"  bitches are comin' up with their friends for a nigga to hit the skins. Hopin' the Kool G Rap was just makin' rhymes, but I'm leavin' bitches' vaginas with more stitches than Frankenstein. Some even had the nerve to try to give me head, and swallow the whole jimmy to make a nigga fed. But come on you bitches, don't make me laugh; you couldn't deep throat G Rap if you was a motherfuckin' giraffe. Dag, some even fled when they saw the head, cuz G's dick would make you seasick fuckin' me in a waterbed. Don't try to paly me like no sucker, cuz these bitches'll be callin' up Dial-a-Mattress like a motherfucker. You heard the song before; you don't wanna see me, "I'll fuck you on the A-train while I write graffiti." I'll even fuck you in a taxi cab, and after sex with a nigga you'll be buyin' a box of maxi-pads. Soon as you open your legs, no need for no birth control, bitch, cuz my dick is touchin' the eggs. Kool G Rap, the pussy slammer; hell, I'd be talkin' fucked up grammar if you was Bad Mamma Jamma. I ain't small, I'll have you cummin' like waterfalls, and then turn them sugar walls into Carnegie Hall. Leavin' my mark on bitches like Zorro, plus fuckin' bitches so def like there won't be no pussy left tomorrow. Hittin' hoes like it ain't funny, I think about bowls of Cheerios because I want my nuts and honey. Talkin' to all the women that look fine, pretendin' my prick was Moby Dick and have a whale of a time. Now I'm not a deep-sea diver, but I love it when my dick's covered and smothered with saliva. Shit, might even straighten out your dentures, because it's not just a blow job, honey, it's an adventure. But 69, and I ain't with that: I'll go to a Chinese restaurant, bitch, if I wanna eat cats. Because you gotta be brave to eat the tuna, G. So when it comes to pussy-lickin', I'm the chicken of the sea. I should be on the sex channel; not a chump cuz I'm givin' punk-bitches better humps than camels. If you're a virgin, I'll make it fit, because my dick'll pop the cherry and spit out the fuckin' pit. And if you're concerned, my sperm don't burn, and if it did, I'd give that nappy-headed ass a fuckin' perm. Shucks, I instruct a fuckin' lesson. You think it's painless? I hit the anus and fuck up your large intestines. Leavin' you bitches stingin' from the bangin'; my man Jimmy got a hole in his head, but yo, that nigga's still hangin'. Bitch, you'd rather hump a fuckin' whole army, cuz even the Witness Protection Program couldn't hide this man's salami. You fuck around and catch a seizure, before I fuck a hoe I gots ta put the hooker under anesthesia. Lettin' saliva dribble on your nipple, orgasms double and triple sit ripple and turn your ass into a gripple. Then I see you searchin' for the swellin', cuz I'm-a leave a hole so big your gynecologist might fall the hell in. Got damn! I hit the ham right; honeybuns, you can ask my Three Sons, I got the Dick right out the Van Dyke. I'm fuckin' naked girls with fly rhymes, but don't push me, because that pussy will be runnin' for it's nine lives. I know you hookers can't refuse this, but dont' pick me to give no hickeys cuz I'm givin' bitches bruises. Yeah, I'll tear that pussy hole apart, for fuckin' with G Rap after dark, you'd rather jog in Central Park. So if you want kids before I fuck ya, look at the size of my dick, and you'll let out the motherfuckers. Shit, bitches get open like a can; just leave it up to G Rap, cuz I'm the neighborhood Fuck U Man...

Ya must be kiddin', ya gotta change the whole box spring, I ain't bullshittin', you get hit with hysteria, cause I'ma bury a big one inside your private area, All hell is in your tush, when Kool G.

"Rated XXX" Some say that I'm nasty plus, hookaz are mad because they can't outlast me, Girl, you ain't too small, cause I turn your crystal to one size fits all, So if you're still confused when I'm screwin', let me explain to you exactly what I'm doin', Exploring your body like a biologist, inventin' new ways just like a scientist, Taggin' my name on your buns just like a printist, while I'm hurtin' your ass just like a dentist, You're so wild I feel like I'm a zoologist, stretchin' your shit more than a gynecologist, I'm gonna twist your ass to death, miss, and when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist, G Rap is hot blooded, freakin' horny, far from corny, come and jump on me, I'm not small and all, I won't break down a stall, i drive the ass up the wall, Nuts and everything are well in shape, the only thing missin' on my dick is a cape, Let's get togetha, honey, ya never know what's next, and I'ma talk like sex, Rated XXX "Can't ya diggit, Honey?" "Rated XXX" Big girls try to squash me, but I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me, Hit the sack cause I ain't jokin', cause when I start pumpin' shit up, I leave it smokin', So ya betta hold on tight all right, cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite, A stick, a trick, and it kills her, i'm probably related to Long Dong Silver, But it gets gooder and gooder, every time I grab a hooka and I put her on my frankfurter, Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip, cause the only thing I'm lickin' is your ass with a whip, And it's a real freaky scene, i'm hittin' girls with their heads in a guillotine, Why certainly I'm squirtin', bust your nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain, Pushin' your head to the pillow, and givin' more pleasure than a double-headed dildo, A big ass gives me a hard-on, but I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton, Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety, i'll fuck you on the "A" train while I write graffiti, In a restaurant, takin' you straight to heaven, in a cab or the back of 7-11, Whether you're white and the music you like is rock, you can come and get some hip-hop cock, Consider this dick on your clitoris, but never try to flex, cause I'ma talk like sex.

[Chorus: 50 Cent] The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Marley Marl feat. Master Ace, Craig G, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane Album: In Control Vol. 1 Song: The Symphony   Verse 1--Master Ace: Listen closely, so your attention's undivided. Many in the past have tried to do what I did. Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off. Stronger and longer, even with the drum off. I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river. I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a little at a time, new trails are blazin', Action is in effect, and always stays in. Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon.  I am the man in charge and I've been plannin' a jam strong enough that it can life your soul. I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold. Once you hear the capital "A" rap, it'll stay with you for awhile, it won't go away. Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend, and if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again. I project my voice so it's right in the crowd. There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed. And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so, or you'll be stranded, just like Caruso. Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye. A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I  say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone, just for the record, let it be known that my ego's only partially grown. And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm. That verse was the calm, now here's the storm... Next up (Yo, I believe that's me). Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony.   Verse 2--Craig G: This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics that though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes. But that's alright, cuz now I'm back to kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me not rockin' rhymes like I always used to, but you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew. You said, "Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin? Yo Craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'! I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?" That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode. Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed. Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken. I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is to be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience. Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)  Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony...   Verse 3--Kool G Rap Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice, and my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep, and while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep. When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like, and make the people unite. I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip. Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left. Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat. Makin' veterans run for medicine, cuz I put out more lights in a fight than ConEdison. Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage. And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page. Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline, your head is way past bedtime. Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow. My rap is rougher than Brillo. So fear me, don't dare dare me,  and don't compare me to him when you hear me. Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war. Your metaphor sucks more than a whore. You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me, bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force. My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce. Run for water while I break your tape recorder. Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter. Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, to mean the boy is sex. Next... the amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse. This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er. Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger. Next up... (I believe that's me)  Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony.   Verse4--Big Daddy Kane: Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'.  Rough to the endin', you never been in to move the groove with the smooth rap lord; like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured. Down your ear, crisp and clear, as I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here. With a mark left that you can all cling. Cuz rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing. I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces that I'd been there and there at the party. The mic had my prints, and on it was a body. So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown, I'm takin' yours son. So just acknowledge the way that I kick it, cuz if rap was a house, you'd be evicted. And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cuz Daddy's home. And battlin' me is hazardous to health, so put a quarter in your ass, cuz ya played yourself Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid. I'm walkin' the path that Allah made. I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach, so just say when. So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet. My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it. The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger, cuz when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga! You've got the groove, MCs, freeze, stand still, nobody move. It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cuz gotdamn, I'm livin' large like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit. You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it. I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya.

I don't know, but what I do know is this Love hurts when it's comin from the throw of a fist And the list goes on from the mental to the physical Use of verbal abuse, beatdowns, it ain't cool It's bad enough we got it rough in society Opression and poverty, no need to be fightin e- ach other, a brother hits a sister, and he's a bigger nigga He ain't nothin if he gotta hit, pick a Innocent victim three times smaller in size Head honcho, macho in whose eyes? Only a fool tries abuse to utilize  Phyisical force to control, hurt, brutalize Time for change, to rearrange the chain of thought Unball your fist and think of the pain was brought To the hearts of your brother or your sis Love hurts when it's comin from the fist [ Def Jef ] Now I want you to think of six women that's close to you And I want you to think if somebody was beatin on em What would you do?

He beats you and mistreats you Daddy wouldn't do that"  But she said: "Your daddy did it too" Ain't that much love in the world to be gettin bruised for Used, abused or even singin the blues for He's addicted to inflictin abuse, he said he'll quit If he's the one with the habit, then why you always takin the hit? A weak later the same shit - I doubt it I'm grown now, mommy, don't even worry about it (In 20% of child abuse cases a spouse will be involved in) [ VERSE 3: The Poetess ] I was twelve years old when daddy started to get rough Puff in one hand, the other holdin a glass of that 80 proof stuff He never got enough, I thought he was tough, but it was all a bluff I tried to understand and got verbally beat down But I thought one day he would come around But man, oh man, was I mistaken Nothing's right in his life and the abuse I was takin I was accused of things I never thought of Good grace got no praise But I got a lotta negative words thrown in my heart like a dart With the point of steel Killin me softly at his will The big one came when I got the blame for Not bein the joy of a boy that he aimed for One day I came home, he was sittin in the chair by the front do' Just waitin to let go (Where you been all night, out hoein?) He didn't raise, rolled up in his gut, I got a blow And that was it, the last hit, he'll ever do The pearl handle was popped and cocked and it blew The only thing on my mind was payback, let's say that I've put an end to that madness and pray that I can overcome what mentally dad did well While I count the days in my padded cell (Several women a day are killed by ah, battering) (Listen to the hit)	--> Ice Cube [ VERSE 4: Kool G. Rap ] Does he love her or does he hate her? That's what I'm thinkin as I look at mommy hooked up to a respirator It started with a smack And that smack became a punch and then a kick and then a broken back But mommy never dropped dime Now she's damn near blind, yo, what the hell is on my pop's mind? I feel like gettin daddy done in And put like one in his gun and pull the trigger and start runnin Man, I see the walls turnin red I'm gettin kinda fed so instead of the lead, how bout a burnin bed? In order for my mother to last So while he's laid up, straight up, I be puttin some gas on his ass Blow him up like a grenade And this is for all the times my mother used to wear shades Tryin to cover the damage he did her So when that fire's on your ass you remember how you hit her [ The Poetess ] This is a special dedication for my sister Dee and all the sisters out there that have been physically and mentally abused I like to send a special thanks to Def Jef And my sister Almighty and definitely Mister Kool G.

Rap] Niggaz get caught up in the struggle End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble Hit the blocks with a portion to double Flip and get tossed in the huddle Police with one piece short of the puzzle It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle and the G's'll make your knees buckle Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle Cheese double but all the speedy niggaz bleed puddles Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime Pieces of hot lead left in your mind One slug to the left of your spine Forever late to rest on the shrine {"So you think that I'm a fool.."} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Tony Touch f/ Big Daddy Kane, Kool G.
