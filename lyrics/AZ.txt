understand the chosen ones livin thru Christ Blinded time from so many signs shown from greed Tryin to calculate all the funds I blown from weed Started out just a young shorty, wakin the rules Turnin

So many niggaz wanting paper just to make it and spend Purchase jewels, get a whip, lace it with rims Guess greed's the state of mind, must escape in the wind Like so many plots, guns played a part in our feuds For the fact nobody got shot, shit was excused Guess its all the game we go through in life sometimes Win or lose, you pay dues in this life of crime Made for thugs in the world of sex, money and drugs Love is love, but live niggaz hold no grudge [someone talking] What up son?

Lived the best of worlds till the shit went foul From rich to being fucked up and wondering how Was it the, negativity all in my midst? Getting sick of all the cars, bitches all on my dick Guess that there was the living that burned me out From the hoes, clothes and money rolls that turned me out Paperchase, saw the whole shit explode in my face Young hustler, with good intentions going to waste Is the road that we all take, thinking its right? Hypnotized by all the bright neon lights in the night Fascinated by the pretty things and growing wealth Can saturate the mindstate and make you go for self Made for thugs in the world of sex, money and drugs Love is love, but live niggaz hold no grudge [someone talking] Y'all niggaz trying to shine Back in the day, we was before our time We had more determination on our mind Than all the big niggaz in the Fed joint combined Y'all need to wake and get this money [AZ] Was it all a dream? Sometimes I sit and I laugh Was it for the cream we sit there, subtracting the math Reminscing how we had it smashed, chopped it in half First Lex coupe kitted, niggaz copped it and crashed Moving fast, still kept the cops on our ass Thank God for the radars on top of the dash What a life, scrambling nights Was it right, or was we just hustlers caught in the hype? Poor or rich, I suggest niggaz never to flip Its cheddar to get, today we get whatever and split So till death do us, from O.D.-ing with the Tech shooters To Lex Lugers in this game full of late doers Made for thugs in this world of sex, money and drugs Love is love, but live niggaz hold no grudge [someone talking] I know the game is y'all fix Rule number one, anything can happen in the mix Real niggaz don't lie and real niggaz don't die They get eye to eye and meet each other halfway across the sky Thats why we stand like we stand, talk like we talk, bop like we bop Jump in the motherfucking Maybach, and hop like we hop Know'm sayin?

In the presence of old parolies My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools Solitude certifies all moves So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave Absorbing fast, learning from niggaz I lost in the past Its poison plays in these foul days Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze Holding my brain trying to maintain Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises Poor images, project life drained my innocence It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed My old earth identify, though her soul is for the church She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets I know the ropes, certain niggaz to slow to cope & though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth & days & though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head Eyes red, it's "Doe or Die" till I'm dead I played all positions, plus learned from each mission Politic wit all type niggaz wit different diction I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry So play the game, other slow up change the lane Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating Or play a part of them investigating It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing Unknowing first time felons on trial
