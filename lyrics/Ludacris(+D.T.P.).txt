Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war Curiosity killed the cat, why I'm Curious George? Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz And just cause somethin looks good don't really mean that it is Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife And take the necessary steps to try to change my life I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?

Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes In the upper downtown, wherever it was The people around you, the things around you cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book God called you a prophet When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out And it commands attention, it commands change I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you And in the midst when you're, starting to understand that I caught the wrong message, and now it's time I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God He said, "Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation" Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you It's time to stop the killing I said it's time to stop the stealing It's time to stop disrespecting our women It's time for us to come home and raise our children It's time for us, to really mold our communities It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion But to get hooked up in relationship, with God And the amazing thing about it is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess and you can tell God "I'm sorry; I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me And I may have done the things, that they said I did But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be and I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!" You can't resist the change And you're not condemned by your yesterday If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny Move, change, and be, now! [Chorus Three: sung by choir] Searchin so looooong, lost in the clouuuuuds Tryin to stay strooooong, and make you prouuuuud - make you proud!

street of Old Nash And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh My clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's And I had to fix a good bag and make decisions and haste Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste So let's get looney up on the set cause I got five on the fire Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer Lookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin' My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest Cause we ridin' [Chorus: Chimere] Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide [Verse 2] It's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that It's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back I right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends Today you see and then you cruise through the West end They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times I got em' all in check when it comes to bustin' rhymes Don't sweat the technique cause I just move the crowd My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride [Verse 3] See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road I heard the squad was wiped up so I flipped my mode On my way to D-E-C, baby can't you see That Decatur is totally to B-I-G for thee Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked I should be gettin' it cause life is too got damn short And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto Back to the C-P, I put the pedal to the metal God bless the child that's just got his own Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride [Verse 4] Cause it's the A-T-L Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell We get the cash and the ass then bail We leave a trace but never leave a trail Say it again Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell We get the cash and the ass then bail We leave a trace but never leave a trail [Chimere ad-libs

So being in the depts of solitude, if you ask me Is were the true heros of our times stay. Tupac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever Rest In Peace, live in harmony...
