previous page  Artist: Company Flow Album: Funcrusher Plus Song: Last Good Sleep Typed by: OHHLA.com At night I cover my ears in tears The man downstairs must have drank too many beers But one day you'll pay Doomed to this kid that you fueled with anger actions Disgust mostly sick most, never have satisfaction Till your bones melt high incident clips and crumple zones Hold a fix on you eternal, intruder interrupting my zone Dwell the matter I must follow, why you proposed only the lonely know Swallowed my mother when she was hollow Who can blame a woman like her, singular parent One love already dissolved and the solution left polluted Two kids with a father who broke out as resoluted So fuck it she needed love and you provided false clout Stomping on the bottom man and I wish she just walked out Knew you was jacked as a stepfather, bit my tongue on the issue Next to stormy weather and forced tolerance but secretly vexed Wish I would have spoke on it but why deny the bliss Mom's with a new husband casting needles puncture pressure Briefly lifted the guilt from a divorce snuffing her pleasure Now you're all up in the family tree, come broken nuclear With termites corroded in your veins and elected to drown the pain But the pain couldn't quite die with a thrown back whiskey sour Puritan, crushing Moms between rocks for at least an hour Until the day I die x2 That's why At night I cover my ears in tears The man downstairs must have had too many beers Now every night of my life he beats his wife [Until the day I die] Until the day I die Timepiece must've read early morning at least  So I lay death's cousin, woken by the sonics of the beast That somewhere deep beneath me a fracture had seized at my neck Breath was it, a flag that marked the end of my peace Conference of the birds I heard my mother dove cry Not absurd just routined I'd learned Just keep my fucking grill locked and hope the entropy stops me process Stepfather's got to fight verbally when his liver's soaked And products come in bottles stuck with drunken last nerve up too close But I couldn't sense the distinction from the other nights' livest wires Ceremony's sparked again a dry one in comparison to this one Handing crutches to my psyche, I was tripping Huddled up clutching sis I think I heard a dress ripping I should've reacted to that But I didn't know the extent, please You could've caught him in time Yeah, that thought's occurred to me constantly Now I've been digging my head and I don't know what he wants from me Until one of us is dead I suppose That's why At night I cover my ears in tears The man downstairs must have had too many beers Now every night of my life he beats his wife [Until the day I die] Until the day I die x2 Much more than abrupt I heard the silence erupt But it was just a touch of tough love that I heard from above The calm and the climate confused me The dawn was a floozy Barely risen but still beckoning to me The song of the night's events amused me, morbidly In a petrified state I wait, to Deadwood on duty Just tempers flared I figured woozily When all is dead and done a pair is just as fucking happy as they choose to be Now off to where the wild things dwell for shuteye The prospect bored me, awokened by the stepsounds coming towards me A quick glance at my mom's darkened silhouette in the hallway assured me So I sunk with the hope that hibernation would cure me And slept my last sleep while I counted clone sheep And dreamt about nothing for the last time ever The ignorance was blissful just a recollection Of the gift of innocent times from a merciful deception Woke to hazy landscapes to find my world defied the laws my mind mandates Patching jugulars with Band-aids The turn on you laid well above my bed Were here and only barely through the shock of what her broken face told me You should have known what happened I was young and oblivous He almost killed your mom If I knew I could have done something You'll never see him again Yeah but I see him every night And cover my ears in tears as he beats his fucking wife At night I cover my ears in tears The man downstairs must have had too many beers Now every night of my life he beats his wife [Until the day I die] Scott Bivins Until the day I die x12 The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Company Flow Album:

I've been wondering how arrogant it is for me to keep doing the things that killed so many that we know (Know know know) {Murs/Slug} I've been noticing how quickly motherfuckers have the answers to existence just as soon as someone goes (Go go go) {Murs/Slug} We change the channel for a week or so of cleansing and reflecting on ourselves but then it's back to that old show (Sh-sh-show) {Murs/Slug} I hear the cackles of the crowd, they're laughing at us and we haven't even gotten to the part where it's a joke The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: El-P Album: I'll Sleep When You're Dead Song: Poisenville Kids No Wins/Reprise (This Must Be Our Time) Typed by: sensative_new_age_guy@hotmail.com {*Muffled*} This is the sound of what you don't know killing you This is the sound of what you don't need still true This is the sound of what you don't want still in you [Verse 1] When a live wire lights little metal rail right When a marvel of engineering steered me clear in to the plight Right before the bodegas open, after the peak of night before the paper's delivered I sat on the corner and sparked a light The same corner I perched when I zone dropped on the block first At almost 5 o'clock watching for sun spots or store clerks Alone spot, almost kinda like the zone was forgot As if the grid had been reset and couldn't catch to the clock  Or the stoop was stuck in the past a half minute and I sat in it With a loosie Newpy drift out of my lips, taste; half minted [Verse 2] And I felt like a hundred bucks in the pocket of a gambling lush at a wondershowzen flow with the droids of destructo luck Fugitoid on the run again, the sky gleamed the maroonist coloring Layered against the bluest tone from where the thunder lived and here I was directly under it Like some dejected little grey they told to stay and wait for the mothership A cotton ball in a blizzard of mischief or brain prison With a thought that rode on the bus and came for conjugal visits and fucked it's way into my grey matter, the tattered territory Stayed chattering and nagging till it demanded it yell it for me And I tried to hold the thing back but the meditation was otherly Fixated on what a friend said and relating it to my struggling "Metropoloid void so damn smothering" But we were children of poisenville and saw the seduction less repugnant And reserved the right as the triggerman with the back up plan of self destruction And I touched the type of chemicals that could pull me towards that function It's the stuff I find hard for discussion How the fuck do you explain your own self destruction and still remain trusted? [Verse 3] To answer the question, yes - the city wants you gone and thats the only thing connecting us, but the connection is so strong So how dare you assume that I'll sleep when you're dead This is well outside the boundries of acceptable behaviour I will not give you the go ahead and you will not be remembered fondly I'm throwing down the gauntlet, fuck you this isn't your decision and for all the holy fuck I give, your little spectacle is ended But dont think for just one second you've honored your obligations to me I'm serious look in my eyes, I don't find this funny  or whatever you imagine poetry and justice feels like when you combine them I am not going to allow this on my watch buddy, nobodies impressed with your imagined sacrifice device or insurmountable regret You are not uniquely pained and if you go we won't be sorry and who the hell are you to put me through the banality of watching this Cause many better men have gone for clearly better reasons and I starkly must remind you that you have not even been trying And that's the only thing remarkable about you, stop me if I'm lying We are always outnumbered but we were never out militiad There's no dignity for criminals, no ministry for the wicked In this town if you make a sound you're the leper with the most fingers The League of Extraordinary Nobodies, the other teams bringing in ringers No faith in the majority, no hope for the little ones Sally pulled a pistol out, billy got a blunderbous So what the fuck are you feeling that makes your struggle so wonderous? Enough to arrogantly pull what's left of the rug out from under us? I think not, you're in the same barrel all us other crabs are caught And if I have to live, you have to live; whether you like this shit or not {Vocals in brackets by Charlyn Marshal} Dedicated to the drowning, and the noble futility of the desperate friends forced to watch (Never again) And to my good friends who refused to allow it to happen to me (Never again) You know who you are, you know what I'm talking about (Never again) Believe me, man I promise (Never never never gonna get that way again) {X8} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Run the Jewels Album: Run the Jewels Song: Run the Jewels Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com, Run the Jewels [El-P] Oh dear, what the fuck have we here?

The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Aesop Rock f/ El-P Album: Bazooka Tooth Song: We're Famous Typed by: urbanoxygen@hotmail.com [El-P] I brought that genuine shit in '96 Before you knew the underground or independent existed I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering A hardcore poetic informed without burglary Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me Everytime I prescribe a new pill, revolution Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks "Bad Touch Example" that soon became bucks Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from Screaming out "Independent's fucked up" in the same tongue With an indelible squad of design monsters Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit Imposterous son is taking the world hostage Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress Now I've come from the '80s juvenile Brooklyn Where cats was like: "Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin." Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences Waiting way before the four you had laced in And I was taught to wait patient (Why?) Only faggots make shit up just to get famous So when I finally blew up I remained sick Earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement Back when the independent scene remained faceless We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels Hold it sacred, living it for the culture Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures That's why I always get respect from true soldiers While half of the critics claim it every year: "Hip hop's over." FUCK YOU, hip hop just started It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it But true veterans'll give dap to those who started it Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit New slang, new thought, new sound Who's heart you thought you had? You clown, you don't, you drown I won't dumb it down, I'm dumbing now for these rounds I'm a live mothefucker plus I'm gunning for clowns You're mine motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds So you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one And even though they were soft they had fun But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from Some of these faggots used to send me their demos I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels But since they had no identity from the start They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part They've been failing for years and call themselves Vets, that's bold Motherfucker, you're not a Vet you're just old I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerve racket Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard Jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit I've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once And ya'll trying to chase me You don't innovate because you can't innovate It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys Keep your identity crisis under the table I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous [Aesop Rock] Check it For the best in the vendor biz 1-800-Lazerface Leave the last CE-Offer crabs and buy them Hatorade Dig it, daddy dug his own tunnel under the gutters where the numbers bleed Hunters froze up and exposed Rapunzel weeds Tugboat, tug up through that brutal dirt first The fuedals fuming oodles, it was right under your poodle skirt Welcome to Bazooka Works, halogen halo eyesore The revolution will not be apologized for Warbucks exlex megaphone on the fashion piggy pageant While my dick's raw-dogging a style magnet Fraggle rock your four figure watch I clock ninety-nine cent wristbands And still know the time when you record flops Now this is on a sick with it factor Exhibit A, E, F, Genesis of the klepto reactor Wanna burgle the buzz over definitive cash After a life of labor camps starts paying innovaters back Baby, you ain't felt the collective?

Yeah, I'm sorry, you don't get to play today But after my crew wins the game, you can soak the coach with Gatorade It's safe to say you're a ways away from the action Your image is imaginary and this song is love-tapping you on the shoulder And asking, "Is this what you had planned?" While I'm slapping 'em senseless, you can feel free to bystand... [Hook] Can't really see from the cheap seats. Can't hear unless you listen Can't get on the field and play if you don't got the right equipment Can't hear what you're saying unless you step up to the mic Wanna see life?

Can't hear unless you listen Can't get on the field and play if you don't got the right equipment Can't hear what you're saying unless you step up to the mic Wanna see life? Well this is what it sounds like...

Take up your cross-section of the populace and follow You're not promised tomorrow So just move, move, we can't stop speaking until they all know We're not promised tomorrow... [Hook] [Verse 3: Bigg Jus] Seminal mimicry trickery gloomy cavalry garrisons Who battle charlatans who love night targeting The faintest comparison imbalancement crucially embarrassing So woefully inadequate Staring at other rhyme ancient and tailored so massive Armchair quarterback chemical ali HAZMAT You're just a little boy in a bubble with unrealistic dreams of a rap body double And rhyming as a meal-ticket That's why this culture got you lovesick Born word eternal, life orbit, Keebler elf timing Couldn't even flow on beat if the kick and snares were color coded With dreams of a new bullet-proof 7 all dubs and silvery But you lack any bass in your voice, cadence or delivery And there's already been two Agatha Christie unsolved rapper murder mysteries Don't let the sharks smell the bloody chum in the water And start a feeding frenzy Sometimes I feeling like I'm in an underground purgatory Trapped between materialistic playa gunfire And suburban nerdy voice, funny voice falsetto War prone with a howitzer patrolling the 33rd parallel rhyming no fly zones With homeland security all tainted and corrupted If you ain't coming with that '88 Daddy Kane R-A-W Like it was on the eve of destruction Trust me, don't even touch it Or get left on the side of the road and circled by buzzards Or fossilized in some tar pit We call it craps now they be triple and doubling it Ever since Tupac's style gave birth to quintuplets Biting is not a birthright, you starry eyed chipmunk Gazing in the 18-wheeler headlights, waiting for the collision Soccer-mommy waste of battle ammunition So younguns, we lop 'em off earlier than circumcision Stay hidden, Jiminy Crickets and all is forgiven This was craft worked at Dust's crib Then manchild slid to haunted gorilla silver back mountain lion of Judah These bear paws hide zirconium claws made for pouncing Even though I don't eat meat anymore It's just order of selection prototype MC's look tasty like melon, tofu and curry rice. Mmmmmm Succulent with the slightest hint of lime Way up in the nosebleed seats with torn ACL's on the sidelines Coming rougher than one time with colorful things that go bump in the night And magical 180 reverse suplex clotheslines You need to slow down and think twice You ain't a risk taker with the flow.

But what comes around hits home and goes back 'round He got home and saw his brother soaked in blood on the ground Moms cryin, a look in her eyes so foul He knew right then and there he had to change his life all around Tears flooded, he looked up and crouched down Called the Lord's name out loud, blacked out, passed out And woke up to a voice in his head so strong It was his brother sayin just what he had said all along Get off the block, put your energy back into your songs Revenge is wrong, show the world that you grown and that you came up! {*scratches by DJ Big Wiz fade out*} The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Mr. Lif f/ Akrobatik, El-P, Jean Grae Album: I Phantom Song: Post Mortem Typed by: eric@brokermetrics.com [Vast Aire] Vision is blurred yo [Mr. Lif] This is the last chapter Bombs hit who?

Cruisin down the highway on a bright summer day Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away Watchin the patriots win the super bowl Grabbin that fumble from Ricky Prole Or my stereo provided me with rhythm and soul I don't know, all I know is I feel guilt for Every single thing I've ever bought and sold I shoulda been at more demonstrations Planted bombs in corporations Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows Burned billboards and torn posters I coulda read more Finally I get to meet this god they left us dead for And its ill, its power to the form of a bill To which people killed by manipulated free will Conscience be the crucifix a chopping block for poppycock And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk Enough talk! Here's my last chance to cherish a thought My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot So to my love I hated to leave you alone Parted my zone passion took me to places and my life was a poem Baby I was on my way home about to catch a flight Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light Love you gave me made me shine You're gorgeous with a powerful mind You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine I'm at peace with my life cause knowin you was divine You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dying Now we're all ground by the grind Out of luck and out of line, out of signs And now we're out of time...
