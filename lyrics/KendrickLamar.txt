You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears Or run through a pothole at two in the morning Scared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it See I know, when the harsh reality takes toll Open up your contacts, then scroll ("hey what's up daddy?")

I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to Ray's killer Ask him why as my eyes fill up Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas It's a jungle when the niggas in zoo The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel to make karma come faster than she normally will It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out Until then, my feet planted on the ground Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding And if I get no answer, just know I tried I should have never looked into his son's eyes Ray Charles voice [Kendrick Lamar] This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God? Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever So the next time you feel like your world's about to end I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again I'd rather not live like there isn't a God than die and find out there really is, think about it The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kendrick Lamar Album: Kendrick Lamar EP Song: Trip Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com "Boarding completed  I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3  Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes  and we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet  At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features  Relax and breathe normally" [Kendrick Lamar] Uh, coming down like I'm uphill Hogging both lanes better than a bus will She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather then step out like Chicago in its finest era You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort Ha-ha, I let the world know I chose to keep to myself and let the world go And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson And I'm a trip Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now I got enough of the mojo to go around So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town cause I'm a trip [Kendrick Lamar] Landing on another runway, fly with me or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on like we never been off, straight shots of Patron I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those And she know what this is, hey lil' mama Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?

Wrong Insecurity roams the black community Homes where kids must have jewelry The high school female need earrings and details so she can be cool to be amongst popularity The various name brands that reach the price scan that's not about the right price, but more like the right scam to rule us all, confuse us all Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain in a Range that is not paid for My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house that lives around his neck like a white collar So why fast forward? Then I rewind A time machine can help me double back to slavery times Picking cotton from a field that a white man own The blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity Before your vanity they parted our families They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed The more we were afraid, the more they made rules and trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh~! And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts and a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation See what we facing is now coming, back to the roots Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot? Call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to a modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she foobie She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though We filling up the gas for Rollies Upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding Kobes My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss Slaves Uh, I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing Barely had clothes on our back It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change we over-exaggerate on our living expenses So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house You're a vanity slave If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing You're a vanity slave If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it and on the back of the window it says "get on my level hoe" You're a vanity slave We all vanity slaves and with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at? I'm not from around here Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho? Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month You know them checks come in I'm tryna get something, but what up?

If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect That means I'll be fronting, hmm Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me Knowing that I'm misunderstood So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty and all I could say is, will the radio care? Yeah, or should I say no? Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?

I'm inspired, so get inspired And so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted? Why you couldn't be a con-artist? Why you couldn't Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious the moment that we first started? Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time? Why you let me use yours cause I don't got mines? Why you always lift me up when I'm completely giving up? Or when niggas holler what's up, you give a dry response? Why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it? Why you always buy me something when you going shopping? Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me? Want my company rather than going club hopping Why you treating my momma like she your momma too? Why you making promises that you'll forever do? Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you, sometimes [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Javonte) We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us (Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share  nothing in common, it ain't fair  But where do we seem to fall?  Where do we seem to fall?  Tender love and care, once upon a time  Once upon a time, we was there) [Kendrick Lamar] And so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me? Why you don't know what you mean to me? Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed out in public, curse me out and make a scenery? Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me? Why text messages popping up saying hi daddy? Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function? I be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me Why you slip and say her name when we having sex? Why you always assuming that I still love my ex? Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat Why you never know how it feel to be lonely? Why I feel I'm the last option after your homies? Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go even though you get violent and put your hands on me? Sometimes [Outro: Lamont Carey "She Says She Loves Me"] She says she loves me, she says she loves me so she clings to me even when I want to be left alone But she's beautiful Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen and she only gives advice, she says when I give her a cue She says she loves me Like when I wake up in the morning she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me She says she needs me, she says she loves me Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off She says, she says she loves me So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake she says, she says she loves me And I don't know about love The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Schoolboy Q Album: Overly Dedicated Song: Michael Jordan Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com [uncredited female] I used to want to be like Michael Jordan Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune [Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] Uh, every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit don't stink Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes Michael Jordan Bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce [Kendrick Lamar] This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich Pull up on them twenty-sixes, I'm a vanity slave I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see I'm a Comp-town representer, concrete backflipper A.K.A. that nigga, don't worry I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see This is HiiiPoWeR, since the Eddie Bower I've been popular I'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come You jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping her?

[Kendrick Lamar] Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen The seven cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars Just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet [Kendrick Lamar] And Lord knows she's beautiful Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore Her anatomy is God's temple and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys Remember sergeant let her slide Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police [Kendrick Lamar] And Lord knows she's beautiful Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction At first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street Keisha's song Mm, my little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face the day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed

Black boy fly {*2X*} Black-black boy fly Black boy fly [Kendrick Lamar] I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo, he was the one to follow He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows He would live in the gym We was living in sorrow Total envy of him He made a dream become a reality Actually making it possible to swim His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30 Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder That we was just moving backwards The bungalow where you find us The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals He had his back like a spinal meanwhile We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl 11 graders gone wrong He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron Now watch that black boy fly Black boy fly Watch that black boy fly Black boy fly Watch that black boy fly Black boy fly Watch that black boy fly Black boy... [Kendrick Lamar] I used to jealous of Jayceon I used to jealous of Jayceon, Taylor when I was young Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar For the name of The Game they line in front of the store Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities Chillin my conscience next to a villain Compton made you believe success wasn't real Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal So as I peel through these lottery tickets I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block So watch that black boy fly [Kendrick Lamar] My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted Like most of the winners call it Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40 And shortly, I got discouraged Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase Only one in a million will ever see better days Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy All these niggaz facetious and they all standing beside me They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle When 2 niggaz making it out had never sounded logical 3 niggaz making it out, that's mission impossible So I never believed the type of performance that I could do I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...

Blige] And I'm so happy I cry Cause I can't believe All the things I ever wanted Are finally happening for me And it's so surreal That I almost feel That any minute I can wake up From this fantasy When you play so hard And you've come so far And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more And I'm gonna do it Watch me [Chorus] - 2X The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: Kendrick Lamar Album: good kid, m.A.A.d city Song: County Building Blues (Bonus Track) Typed by: Hdub [Intro] Greetings boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls) My name is Petey P.

It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has very high visibility,  which is why stop signs, stoplights and fire equipment are usually painted red. It also represents one-third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewelry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy.

Does the sight of us leave you guessing, or do you understand the stressing?  The aggression, the look of no hope on my niggas' faces  like the Lord overlooked us when he handed down his graces  You see embraces fall short on the numb tips of street entrepreneur fingers  Stuck on the walls of the project halls where the coke smell still lingers  External blingers is all we can be, cause on the inside we've been given nothing to shine on  And a gig is harder to get than coke, so niggas get they grind on  cause the TV tells us, aim high nigga, make all goals lateral  But see that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put they souls up as collateral  Now, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em, make an excuse to sell 'em  But when a nigga goes from not doing to doing, what can you tell him?  Not to be a nigga? Shit, I gots to be a nigga, that's how I pay the bills  and I'ma do that whether I got to sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills" The Original Hip-Hop (Rap) Lyrics Archive   Back to the previous page  Artist: ScHoolboy Q f/ Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar (Black Hippy) Album: Setbacks Song: Rolling Stone Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com [Ab-Soul] Drugs and girls Uh, show me some love, my love Last time I checked, you loved my love Placed nothing above my love If you leave, come back, like above your butt No ifs, ands or buts Yes I'm fishing, but I still wanna fill you up "When the love runs high" Hah, just when you thought enough was enough I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty [Kendrick Lamar] Hoe, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind I wanna touch up and down your spine "When the love runs high" Hmm, a perfect ten living on cloud nine I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time Anything that can get me out of my mind I'm a rolling stone who needs another home especially "when the love runs high" (Now everybody in the place) Tote, tote, tote, tote Tote, tote, tote, tote (Do it till you can't feel your face) Chug, chug, chug, chug Chug, chug, chug, chug (Everybody in the place) Tote, tote, tote, tote Tote, tote, tote, tote (Do it till you can't feel your face) Chug, chug, chug, chug (Now stop, and just groove) [ScHoolboy Q] Uh, faded off life See the dope man, time to get right Uh, open up a Bud Light Don Julio, Coronas, comas Bad bitches, bad bitches Calling bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness Uh, "when the love runs high" Pfft, whatever that mean Uh, need a shot, you the vaccine You pumping through my veins, I'm a crack fiend Uh, you're the crack Uh, drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur [Jay Rock] Bend you over in a Rover, it's over Never sober, my cup runneth over "When the love runs high" Better know girl, you fucking with a soldier [Jay Rock] Blunts and broads Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God Baby tryna grab my drawers They call me Dozer, I knock down walls Jose, that's my homie He'll have you calling Earl in a hallway "When the love runs high" I gotta come down just to party I'm turned up, maxed out Willie Manchester, blow your back out Baby girl, my advice, better back out Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house [Ab-Soul] Listen ma, I got a role you can act out and then like Prince' pants, get yo' ass out I don't need a princess, I need a mistress I'll stick a dick in a damsel in distress 'Soul~!

I mean damn these hoes get paid, all you do is get laid, this shit don't add up" She said "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love, even if I know it ain't real love Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it then never call back, I still fuck" And that's fucked up cause she's so trill, I need somethin, she go steal When the trap hot and police ride, nigga guess where we go chill? About fo' years she held dope and my fo'-pound 'til it go down I remember shawty, she stayed down, I won't say her name cause she married now [Chorus: Kris Stephens] When the lights go out and I'm in my bed I think of all the madness in my hea-aaaaaaaaaaaaaad Oh-oh-ohhhh, all of the things that I did back then Ohhhh, when I'm in my bed I think of all the memories I've ha-aaaaaaaaaaaaaad Oh-oh-ohhhh, all of the things that I did back then [B.o.B] Yo, yo uhh She would always turn heads when she fall through, she would always make moves how a boss do And she never gave any nigga time of day, but she the chick all the niggaz tried to talk to But when it came to me she had a thing for me, when we kicked it she rolled up the weed for me And we'd both cut class, post up in the cut steady watchin just to see if the police comin We got close over time her and I, right around the time that I first got signed Come to think about it I was 'bout 17, I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive I was goin back and forth with these flights, another show after show, each night She became so suspicious of these other bitches she'd go through my phone and we'd fight Talk about torn between the two, wasn't really much more that we could do Wasn't really much space for us but she stayed down with every tour she seen me do But I guess one night I had a few, huh, one night I had a few Yeah, this lil' chick that caught my eye, I told her "Hurry up, meet me at the room" And no, I didn't have a contraceptive, and my common sense neglected And two months later next thing I know I got a text that said "I'm pregnant" And you can almost bet she kept it, and that's the reason why you left me On top of all that, it wasn't even mine, I went and got paternity tested Damn! [Kendrick Lamar] Wait, hold up, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school? Jay 305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit You said "I won't ride until Kendrick drive a new Monte Carlo that cruise" And that shot my pride, I tried to improv but no freestyle'll ever do You're lookin for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti You're overlookin every nigga that ain't quite ready To make it rain on you like about to break a levee - HOLD UP! That pussy petty Yeah yo' nails did, yo' hair did, yo' cell phone is selfish It only got numbers that come with a Hummer, her new primadonna I smelt it Tried to make you mine hoe, tried to make some time hoe But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line hoe Her dreams holds Versace, she fall for Armani Only deal with rich niggaz, fuck you and Mitt Romney I'm grown now, I'm on my own now, I'm po-o-o-oppin Change my phone now, when I get home now I got o-o-o-options Fast forward, wait, is that you?
