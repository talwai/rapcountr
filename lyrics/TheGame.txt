Eminem might do If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after ?DeBars? got slapped When Doc say its a wrap.. (its a wrap) Its still Aftermath, and ain't nothing after that [Verse Two: Game] I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed And even though sometimes I run loose You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef But you told me it was okay to say "Fuck The Police" Now its my turn to carry the torch.. And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source Remember when we got drunk, to do 'Start From Scratch'? I told you.. you was like a father to me.. I meant that Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plats Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track When Doc say its a wrap.. (its a wrap) Its still Aftermath.. and ain't nothing after that... [Verse Three: Busta Rhymes] See when the world is on your shoulder.. and the stress grows bigger The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga Most of the time I let 'em know.. I dont agree wit' what he do But he a hardhead Dre.. thats why I'm talkin' to you See.. when I first met my nigga.. son was layin' in the cut Type reserve, homie was quite and kept his mouth shut Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck As time went on, now he was workin' with the finest I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance You gave him something that can make or break a nigga.. you should face it So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction The only was.. our little nigga wouldn't listen But when Doc say its a wrap (its a wrap) Its still Aftermath And ain't nothing after that...

Cause sometimes I wanna give up and at least take a break That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face...  *singing* [Nas] Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seating and greeting I've been meanin' to do me some letter reading to the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin' Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks Should never be aloud at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude Martin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin' As a kid I ain't relate really I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your world awoke in me First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad I ain't even know the strength you had to have the march You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart, we miss you...  Feel like King be in me sometimes *singing* [The Game] The word nigger, is nothin' like nigga Don't sound shit alike - like Game, like Jigga One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin' If Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march? I know Obama would but would Hilary take part? Great minds think great thoughts The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's "Umbrella" for Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call that the future just took a fuckin' head shot...  I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped Would he give me the answer? Probably not...  *singing* Artist: (The Game f/) DMX Album: L.A.X.

It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has very high visibility,  which is why stop signs, stoplights and fire equipment are usually painted red. It also represents one-third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewelry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy. Artist: The Game f/ Dr. Dre, Sly, Snoop Dogg Album: The R.E.D.
